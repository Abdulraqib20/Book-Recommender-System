        "description": "\u201cTHE SORCERER\u2019S RING has all the ingredients for an instant success: plots, counterplots, mystery, valiant knights, and blossoming relationships replete with broken hearts, deception and betrayal. It will keep you entertained for hours, and will satisfy all ages. Recommended for the permanent library of all fantasy readers.\u201d--Books and Movie Reviews. This bundle includes the first two books in Morgan Rice\u2019s #1 Bestselling fantasy series THE SORCERER\u2019S RING (A QUEST OF HEROES and A MARCH OF KINGS), a 17 book epic fantasy series with over 1,000 five star reviews. These two bestselling novels are both here in one convenient file. It is a great introduction to the SORCERER\u2019S RING series and it also makes the perfect gift! A QUEST OF HEROES (BOOK #1 IN THE SORCERER\u2019S RING) revolves around the epic coming of age story of one special boy, a 14 year old from a small village on the outskirts of the Kingdom of the Ring. The youngest of four, the least favorite of his father, hated by his brothers, Thorgrin senses he is different from the others. He dreams of becoming a great warrior, of joining the King\u2019s men and protecting the Ring from the hordes of creatures on the other side of the Canyon. When he comes of age and is forbidden by his father to try out for the King\u2019s Legion, he refuses to take no for an answer: he journeys out on his own, determined to force his way into King\u2019s Court and be taken seriously. But King\u2019s Court is rife with its own family dramas, power struggles, ambitions, jealousy, violence and betrayal. King MacGil must choose an heir from amongst his children, and the ancient Dynasty Sword, the source of all their power, still sits untouched, waiting for the chosen one to arrive. Thorgrin arrives as an outsider and battles to be accepted, and to join the King\u2019s Legion. Thorgrin comes to learn he has mysterious powers he does not understand, that he has a special gift, and a special destiny. Against all odds he falls in love with the king\u2019s daughter, and as their forbidden relationship blossoms, he discovers he has powerful rivals. As he struggles to make sense of his powers, the king\u2019s sorcerer takes him under his wing and tells him of a mother he never knew, in a land far away, beyond the Canyon, beyond even the land of the Dragons. Before Thorgrin can venture out and become the warrior he yearns to be, he must complete his training. But this may be cut short, as he finds himself propelled into the center of royal plots and counterplots, ones that may threaten his love and bring him down\u2014and the entire kingdom with him. With its sophisticated world-building and characterization, A QUEST OF HEROES is an epic tale of friends and lovers, of rivals and suitors, of knights and dragons, of intrigues and political machinations, of coming of age, of broken hearts, of deception, ambition and betrayal. It is a tale of honor and courage, of fate and destiny, of sorcery. It is a fantasy that brings us into a world we will never forget, and which will appeal to all ages and genders. It is 82,000 words.",

After all, the prophecy has never been clear on how she is to defeat the Crimson King, only that if it is to be done, she is the one who must find a way. But time is running short, and Jahrra only hopes she'll find the answers before it is too late ... With Nimbronia and the reluctant Creecemind dragons behind them, Jaax and his ward travel with their friends to Dhonoara, the valley of the elves, where the Coalition of Ethoes gathers to prepare for battle. But the Tanaan dragon isn't as confident as usual; there are far too many devious players in this game, and it is no longer just about winning or losing for him. Freedom from the Tyrant and his ancient curse may come at too high a price. As open war looms, both Jahrra and Jaax will be tested in mind, body, heart, and spirit. Old friends and enemies will emerge, and secrets that have remained buried for centuries will finally be revealed. Even if Jahrra does the impossible by destroying the evil festering in the east, it will come at a great cost. For battles are not fought without risk; wars are not won without sacrifice. In the end, Jahrra must find the strength to do what she must, and the courage to endure her greatest challenge yet. A powerful dragon guardian, a headstrong heroine, and a destiny that will make them both the greatest legends of their time . . . The epic conclusion to the Legend of Oescienne series!",

In the first book, Necromancer's Dagger, the epic saga of the Ardellen family begins. It starts them on a journey that will embroil much of the world before the epic conclusion in the fourth and final novel of the Cathexis Series. The story starts out fairly simply as you follow a dark plot by a necromancer, a noble and a mercenary who are bent on the destruction of the ruling family of Lindankar. But as the story continues through the series more and more is revealed until everything is wrapped up into a Gordian knot that will all be resolved in the grand climax.

        "description": "For lovers of epic fantasy\u2026 In a land where oaths can\u2019t be broken, be careful what promises you make. To break the binding oath is to risk the very magic of Argenterra. Best friends, Sophy and Aria, are on a family trip in Scotland when they find themselves swept away to another world. The lush land of Argenterra is imbued heavily with a magic known as the GIVEN \u2013 but while Aria adapts quickly, able to use and recognize the magic as naturally as if she\u2019d been born in this world, Sophy struggles to find her place. Far from discovering her own magical gifts, Sophy is unable to feel the GIVEN at all. Something about the magic has warped and changed her appearance and she\u2019s lost her vibrancy, becoming a mere shadow of her former self. Previously the attractive, outgoing one, now she is ugly and unable to fit in, whereas Aria has grown in confidence. As Aria thrives, quickly falling in love with a dashing prince, Sophy fights to survive in an increasingly hostile and deadly realm. She pairs up with Oakheart, ambassador to the king, on a quest to discover her true purpose in the kingdom, but soon the darker side of Argenterra and its people becomes apparent to both women. The GIVEN is not without cost \u2013 the laws of this magic dictate that oaths are bound with the GIVEN and the inhabitants of Argenterra bear the mark of the original, ancestral oath to the land. Every promise must be kept or the land\u2019s magic will compel its completion. Only murder can sunder a binding oath and then magic will wane and Argenterra will become the Ungiven Land \u2013 but no native Argenterran has that power. Now trapped by binding promises of their own, Sophy and Aria\u2019s friendship will test oaths and Sophy\u2019s very presence will pose a true threat to Argenterra...",

Mr. King was born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 1977, though his stay in Rio was to be short lived. Adopted from an orphanage, he was raised in Ipatinga's, Valley of Steel. His favorite author is Hemingway; yet his favorite book, is Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath. When he is not writing or reading, he plays chess and the guitar. When Ivan was eight, he read his first book, Judy Blume's Superfudge and the rest is history. That's the story behind how the passion for reading began; how it ends...has yet to be written. Currently, he is working on a couple dozen writing projects and turning some of his novels into screenplays. Ivan\u2019s first published work, Valley of Steel, is a Fiction Novel loosely based on his life growing up in the favelas, or slums, of Brazil.

        "description": "Ivan King is an Award Winning and Best Selling Author of over 30 books. His #1 Book on Amazon, Breakfast With Jesus, has become a major success internationally. Mr. King was born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 1977, though his stay in Rio was to be short lived. Adopted from an orphanage, he was raised in Ipatinga's, Valley of Steel. His favorite author is Hemingway; yet his favorite book, is Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath. When he is not writing or reading, he plays chess and the guitar. When Ivan was eight, he read his first book, Judy Blume's Superfudge and the rest is history. That's the story behind how the passion for reading began; how it ends...has yet to be written. Currently, he is working on a couple dozen writing projects and turning some of his novels into screenplays. Ivan\u2019s first published work, Valley of Steel, is a Fiction Novel loosely based on his life growing up in the favelas, or slums, of Brazil. Favorite quote: \u201cIn life, incredible things happen and unforgettable moments do exist; but nothing compares to having been loved by you, and though you rest in peace, I will miss and love you always.\u201d",

The dialogues are well-written and the author\u2019s meticulous care for plot elements infuses the story with great entertainment.\" K. C. Finn - \"Author Joshua Braun has crafted a completely enchanting work of fiction with plenty of wit to offer readers. One of the features which I found particularly impressive about this piece was its styling, voice, and attitude, which make the author just as important as the story in a way that Sir Terry Pratchett would be proud of. I adored the character development, dynamics, and tongue-in-cheek humor.\" Ruffina Oserio - \" Witch'n is well-plotted and the pacing is fast; there are twists that I didn\u2019t see coming and the unpredictability in plot development makes the story a page-turning read. The descriptions are vivid and strong and from the very beginning, the reader is presented with horrifying images of the aftermath of evil magic. Joshua Braun\u2019s novel is intelligently plotted and superbly executed.\" Foluso Falaye - With an ingenious blend of dark humor and fantasy, Witch'n grabs the reader and holds their attention from start to finish.

There's just one teensy-tiny little problem\u2026 Being good doesn't come easily \u2013 after all, it's much easier to sacrifice babies and summon hideous demons to get things done. Seeking out her old nemesis, a legendary-hero-turned-academic (who she only imprisoned and tortured a little bit), she gives him an outlandish proposition: to help her make a dazzling transformation from wicked witch to good. It's an offer he can't refuse. The odd couple have a long, perilous journey ahead of them and a lot of psychological hang-ups to work through. Can an evil witch ever truly be reformed \u2013 and what could possibly go wrong when you're relying on your nemesis to be your BFF?

        "description": "A pair of imaginative science fiction story collections from the #1 New York Times\u2013bestselling author of Spartacus, Freedom Road, and the Immigrants saga. Over his long and illustrious career, New York Times\u2013bestselling author and prolific novelist Howard Fast proved himself a master of any literary genre, from historical fiction in Spartacus to family generational drama in his bestselling Immigrants saga. Although his output in fantasy and science fiction is relatively modest, these two short story collections, reminiscent of classic Twilight Zone episodes, demonstrate that Fast\u2019s imagination knew no boundaries. The General Zapped an Angel: Nearly forty years after the publication of his first story, \u201cWrath of Purple,\u201d in the science fiction magazine Amazing Stories, Fast returned to the genre with a set of nine supremely entertaining tales. In this collection, a Vietnam general shoots down what appears to be an angel, a man sells his soul to the devil for a copy of the next day\u2019s Wall Street Journal, and a group of alien beings bestow a mouse with human thought and emotion. \u201cThese stories amply display Fast\u2019s considerable gifts as a writer\u2014his clear, concise, often elegant prose, his sense of humor, his gift of sympathetic imagination, and sheer talent as a storyteller.\u201d \u2014Tangent A Touch of Infinity: This follow-up to The General Zapped an Angel offers thirteen brisk and engrossing science fiction stories. In \u201cThe Hoop,\u201d a scientist builds a portal to an unknown destination, which the mayor of New York City hijacks to use as a garbage dump until the location\u2019s surprising\u2014and hilarious\u2014revelation. And in \u201cThe Egg,\u201d set three thousand years in the future, a research team discovers an egg, something they have never seen before, cryogenically frozen in a nuclear bunker. \u201cFast, a master of economy . . . spins his stories quickly and most effectively.\u201d \u2014Associated Press",

        "description": "Love at first sight! I have spent my entire life searching for the perfect wing-whang. But until I'm taken by the dwarven general, Jaden Antida, no man has ever measured up to the heroes I\u2019ve created in my books. A burly and overbearing alpha male, he\u2019s crude, growly and dominant. He says he\u2019s on a mission to destroy the secret entrance to Dwarfholme. And he says he\u2019s my mate. Having written books where the hero and heroine instantly fall in love, I know he\u2019s one hundred percent wrong. There is no way this infuriating \u201cmale\u201d person can be my perfect match. But when a cave-in traps us in the iron mines beneath Cavendish Castle, he is my only hope. Too many tropes! Lots of delicious clich\u00e9s. Plenty of cave chickens! If you like overbearing men who get their comeuppance by a woman strong enough to stand up to them, you\u2019ll love this story. HEA guaranteed, lots of steamy scenes, ogres optional.",

Stephen Russ is a normal guy who finds himself caught up in a strange world of talking rats and elder gods\u2014and the fate of the world rests on his shoulders!What Would You Give to be a Hero? Stephen Russ never expected to have to answer that question; he went to work, he stayed in his apartment, sometimes had friends over, and the worst thing he'd had to face was looking for a new job after losing his old one. But that was before a child's desperate scream led him into an alley filled with faceless winged things that almost killed him, before the strange white rat spoke to him, calling itself Silvertail Heartseeker and telling him that this was but the beginning, that the Stars were almost Right and the forces of Azathoth Nine-Armed would soon be unleashed against the world\u2026 before Silvertail said that his courage and willingness to risk himself made him the perfect choice to be one of the defenders of the world against this evil. A defender named Princess Holy Aura, the first of the five Apocalypse Maidens. Now Steve understands the choice: not whether he is willing to die, but whether he is willing to live\u2026 by giving up \"Stephen Russ\" to become the one chance that the world has against the monstrous forces that wait on the other side of forever.

The image of the dead man comes to her in a flash\u2014when she bumps into the victim's brother and picks up his memory of the crime scene. He's in Las Vegas with his buddies, celebrating his last weekend as a bachelor. Except right now he's doing more begging than celebrating as he tries to convince Tiffany to do some amateur sleuthing and help bring his brother's killer to justice. Tiffany intends to do nothing of the sort. She's not a police detective. She's not a private investigator. She's not even a true-crime aficionado. And she's definitely not telepathic\u2014or so she's desperately trying to tell herself before she becomes another family black sheep like her kooky Vietnamese aunt Tuna. But all evidence indicates otherwise. And if there's a teeny, tiny chance she can help solve this homicide, doesn't she have an obligation to try? Hijinks and hilarity ensue when Tiffany reluctantly agrees to take on the case. But she's only got one weekend to figure out \"whodunit\" before all the suspects flee town\u2014taking their deadly secrets with them.

        "description": "National bestselling cozy mystery author Diane Vallere brings you murder, strippers, and an ice cream parlor decorating project in this latest satisfying installment in the feel-good, amateur sleuth Madison Night mystery series! A diva found dead on a commercial set. A decorator tasked to take her place. Can Madison Night remember her lines before the killer erases her too? Madison Night\u2019s star is on the rise. Thanks to a series of TV spots to promote her decorating business\u2019s grand reopening, she\u2019s busier than ever. The police commissioner, impressed with her screen presence, engages her to replace the original actress in his feel-good campaign for local law enforcement. But when the first spokeswoman\u2019s body is found on set after Madison\u2019s testimonial airs, the last thing the police need is publicity. Madison steers clear of the controversy by focusing on her company relaunch, but when gossip links the victim to someone special in her life, she gets involved by proxy. She uses her soapbox to draw out suspects, but if she\u2019s not careful, it might serve as a coffin instead. Can Madison reveal a hidden killer before the bubble bursts on her newfound success? The Kill of It All is the ninth book in the delightful Madison Night mystery series. If you like Doris Day movies, traditional mysteries, and quirky sleuths, you'll love this charming cozy mystery. What People Are Saying about Madison Night Mysteries: \"Make room for Vallere's tremendously fun homage. Imbuing her story with plenty of mid-century modern decorating and fashion tips, not to mention a steady patter of Doris Day trivia, Vallere debuts a well-paced cozy series. Her disarmingly honest lead and two hunky sidekicks will appeal to all fashionistas and antiques types and have romance crossover appeal.\" - Library Journal \"If you are looking for an unconventional mystery with a snarky, no-nonsense main character, this is it. Madison is a strong leading lady who lands in lots of quirky situations. Instead of clashing, humor and danger meld perfectly, and there's a cliffhanger that will make your jaw drop. You'll look forward to the second Madison Night mystery.\" - RT Book Reviews \"A charming modern tribute to Doris Day movies and the retro era of the 50s, including murders, escalating danger, romance... and a puppy!\" - Linda O. Johnston, Author of the Pet Rescue Mysteries \"It was fast and furious, had a lot of info, characters, suspects, and even a few tangled romances. I love mysteries where I can't figure out who the real killer is until the end, and this was one of those. The novel was well-written, moved at a smooth pace, and Madison's character was a riot.\" - ChickLit Plus \"This was a delightful read for me. I particularly enjoy and like Doris Day and was so surprised that Pillow Talk was mentioned in the book along with Doris Day. It's nice having a cute, cozy mystery to read, I look forward to more in the series!\" -Bookreporter.com \"If you love the Technicolor movies of Doris Day and Rock Hudson and watch Mad Men for fashion tips, author Diane Vallere has written a mystery that will appeal to the mid-century modern heart.\" - ReaderToReader.com \"An intricately plotted and well-written book, I really enjoyed the story. I can't imagine decorating a house in the style from Doris Day's movies but it makes fine reading.\" - Fresh Fiction Keywords: humorous mysteries, cozy mysteries, amateur sleuths, women sleuths, mystery with humor, fashionable fiction, fashionable mysteries, friendship fiction, traditional mysteries, Dallas, Texas, vintage, Doris Day, stylish sleuths, funny mysteries, mysteries set in Texas, funny cozy mysteries, humorous cozy mysteries, traditional mystery, designer mystery, cozy hobby mystery, animal mystery, dog, determined sleuth, female sleuth, women sleuth, fearless sleuth, crime, crime fiction, murder mystery, amateur detective, sleuthing in style, stylish sleuthing, suspense, thriller, over-50 Madison Night Mad for Mod Mysteries (cozy/traditional mysteries winking at Doris Day movies) Midnight Ice (Prequel) Pillow Stalk That Touch of Ink With Vics you get Eggroll The Decorator Who Knew Too Much The Pajama Frame Lover Come Hack Apprehend Me No Flowers Teacher's Threat The Kill of it All Love Me or Grieve Me (Oct 2022)",

Her unofficial investigation takes her back to the small town that thrust her into the spotlight four years ago, when she saved the killer\u2019s last victims \u2013 before the killer took his own life and that of one final victim: a mother who left a ten year old son and loving husband behind.

With the investigation quickly gathering momentum, Kim finds herself exposed to great danger and in the sights of a lethal individual undertaking their own twisted experiment.

Evil Games is a must read book.\u2019 Book Addict Shaun \u2018Silent Scream (Book 1) was quite brilliant. Evil Games (Book 2) is EXCEPTIONAL.

Successful Management by Motivation shows that in a knowledge-based society, this goal cannot be achieved by extrinsic motivation alone. Pay for performance often even hurts because it crowds out intrinsic motivation. To succeed, companies have to find ways of fostering and sustaining intrinsic motivation. With the help of in-depth case studies, representative surveys, and analysis based on a large number of firms and employees, this work identifies the various aspects of motivation in companies and shows how the right combination of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation can be achieved.",

Focussing on higher education, the book responds to the call for providing alternative conceptual models, other than those originating from the Anglo-Saxon world. The authors take a contextual approach and use the case of Saudi Arabia to understand motivation in a collectivist, highly religious and conservative society of the Middle East. Providing empirical findings from a study carried out at two Saudi universities differing in their religious outlook, this book reveals a hierarchy of needs that is significantly different from the theory proposed by Maslow. Religion, culture and gender are explored in detail as the authors investigate the relevance of Maslow\u2019s theory in a region that is of growing interest to policy-makers and practitioners in North America and Europe, offering a truly insightful read to an international audience.",

Small countries typically have limited resources to direct toward investment attraction programs, so the ability to segment the market (of Multinational Corporations looking to invest) is a crucial skill.

Once these groups are identified, their needs - specific preference requirements for laws, regulations, incentives, and general conditions - can be more efficiently addressed.",

        "description": "This book covers the main topics that students need to learn in a course on Industrial Organization. It reviews the classic models and important empirical evidence related to the field. However, it will differ from prior textbooks in two ways. First, this book incorporates contributions from behavioral economics and neuroeconomics, providing the reader with a richer understanding of consumer preferences and the motivation for many of the business practices we see today. The book discusses how firms exploit consumers who are prone to making mistakes and who suffer from cognitive dissonance, attention lapses, and bounded rationality, for example and will help explain why firms invest in persuasive advertising, offer 30-day free trials, offer money-back guarantees, and engage in other observed phenomena that cannot be explained by the traditional approaches to industrial organization. A second difference is that this book achieves a balance between textbooks that emphasize formal modeling and those that emphasize the history of the field, empirical evidence, case studies, and policy analysis. This text puts more emphasis on the micro-foundations (i.e., consumer and producer theory), classic game theoretic models, and recent contributions from behavioral economics that are pertinent to industrial organization. Each topic will begin with a discussion of relevant theory and models and will also include a discussion of concrete examples, empirical evidence, and evidence from case studies. This will provide students with a deeper understanding of firm and consumer behavior, of the factors that influence market structure and economic performance, and of policy issues involving imperfectly competitive markets. The book is intended to be a textbook for graduate students, MBAs and upper-level undergraduates and will use examples, graphical analysis, algebra, and simple calculus to explain important ideas and theories in industrial organization.",

        "description": "This book investigates the relevance of Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of needs as a theory of motivation, whilst taking into account variances in culture and individual experiences and perspectives. Focussing on higher education, the book responds to the call for providing alternative conceptual models, other than those originating from the Anglo-Saxon world. The authors take a contextual approach and use the case of Saudi Arabia to understand motivation in a collectivist, highly religious and conservative society of the Middle East. Providing empirical findings from a study carried out at two Saudi universities differing in their religious outlook, this book reveals a hierarchy of needs that is significantly different from the theory proposed by Maslow. Religion, culture and gender are explored in detail as the authors investigate the relevance of Maslow\u2019s theory in a region that is of growing interest to policy-makers and practitioners in North America and Europe, offering a truly insightful read to an international audience.",

        "description": "Welcome to Cherry Hills, where small-town life can be deadly. This box set includes books four through six of the Cozy Cat Caper Mystery series. If you enjoy light, fun, cozy mysteries without excessive violence, bad language, or graphic scenes, then grab this three-book collection today and join Kat Harper and her two crime-fighting felines in their quest for justice! Vanished in Cherry Hills (Book 4) Is it possible to track down someone who doesn't want to be found? Kat Harper spent most of her childhood in foster care, being raised by strangers while the woman who gave her life quietly slipped into the shadows. Now in her thirties, Kat longs to locate the mother she barely remembers. Little does she know, so do the police. It turns out, Kat's mother is suspected of a crime that's gone unsolved for thirty years. And if Kat is successful in her quest, her mother might reenter her life only to spend her remaining years behind bars. Torn between her greatest wish and her biggest fear, Kat's not sure what to do. Living in darkness for another thirty years isn't an option, but will her need for answers end up forever alienating the one person she yearns to connect with most? Shot in Cherry Hills (Book 5) Animal rescue with a side of murder. What starts off as a foster dog wellness check turns into a nightmare when a gunshot leads Kat Harper to a man's dead body. Eric Halstead's killer is gone by the time Kat arrives on the scene, but the amateur sleuth isn't about to let them get away that easily. By all accounts, this homicide appears to be a neighborhood dispute turned deadly. And now it's up to Kat to determine exactly which neighbor pulled the trigger. Was it the do-it-yourself handyman who didn't appreciate Eric's frequent noise complaints? Or could it have been the local newspaper thief who swears he knows something relevant to the murder but refuses to talk to the police? And Kat certainly can't discount the loudmouthed older gentleman who seems to have a not-always-popular opinion about everything. Kat might not know \"whodunit\" yet, but she knows one thing for sure. There's a lot more than justice riding on this case. With Eric's death comes the need to rehome his beloved tuxedo cat. And if Kat's not careful, this animal rescue mission may end with the newly orphaned feline falling into the hands of a cold-blooded killer. Strangled in Cherry Hills (Book 6) Three cats, two dogs, and one dead body. Kat Harper isn't the only one with a knack for stumbling upon crime scenes. This time she's led to the corpse du jour by her adventurous cat Matty and one determined dachshund. It doesn't take long before the dead man is identified as local dog walker Jeffrey Parr\u2014and his doxie client could be the only eyewitness to this latest Cherry Hills homicide. Kat doesn't set out to investigate, but what can she do when the task of reuniting the dachshund with his owner introduces her to more suspects than she can count? Between Jeffrey's disgruntled clients and his angry exes, Kat has her hands full trying to determine \"whodunit.\" That might be a blessing in disguise though. As the amateur sleuth soon learns, success often comes with a price. And when Kat finds herself in the killer's crosshairs, it might just be up to her furry feline friends to save her from becoming the next murder victim.

        "description": "Ivan King is an Award Winning and Best Selling Author of over 30 books. His #1 Book on Amazon, Breakfast With Jesus, has become a major success internationally. Mr. King was born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 1977, though his stay in Rio was to be short lived. Adopted from an orphanage, he was raised in Ipatinga's, Valley of Steel. His favorite author is Hemingway; yet his favorite book, is Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath. When he is not writing or reading, he plays chess and the guitar. When Ivan was eight, he read his first book, Judy Blume's Superfudge and the rest is history. That's the story behind how the passion for reading began; how it ends...has yet to be written. Currently, he is working on a couple dozen writing projects and turning some of his novels into screenplays. Ivan\u2019s first published work, Valley of Steel, is a Fiction Novel loosely based on his life growing up in the favelas, or slums, of Brazil. Favorite quote: \u201cIn life, incredible things happen and unforgettable moments do exist; but nothing compares to having been loved by you, and though you rest in peace, I will miss and love you always.\u201d",

        "description": "Readers of science fiction dystopia comedy books who also like portal fantasy will (hopefully) enjoy the dry sarcastic humour and satire of this series. There are dark sections and some gallows humour, but this is, for the most part, a light sci fi novel. A man chosen by destiny. The wrong man. Meet The Pan of Hamgee: coward, unwilling adventurer and, by some miracle, K\u2019Barth\u2019s longest surviving outlaw. He just wants a quiet life so working as getaway driver is probably a bad career move. Then he falls in love at first sight with a woman he hasn't even met who comes from an alternative reality. That\u2019s when things really begin to get complicated. Meet Ruth Cochrane: she\u2019s the Chosen One, destined to play a pivotal role in saving K\u2019Barth from a cruel dictator. She\u2019s never heard of K\u2019Barth, though. She\u2019s a public relations executive from London and she\u2019s totally unaware of the chaos about to hit her life. Meet Lord Vernon: power hungry psychopath on the brink of world domination. He wants to cement his hold on K'Barth by kidnapping the Chosen One and forcing her to marry him. Only one person is standing in his way: someone who doesn\u2019t even realise it, The Pan of Hamgee. For The Pan, and Ruth, that\u2019s a deadly problem. Written in British English with some light swearing. There is dark stuff in here but any readers who have read all the Harry Potter books without any worries should be OK with this series. Suggested cinema rating, PG: first novel in a complete science fiction/fantasy series of 4 books Runner up in 2011 Wishing Shelf Awards Awarded Awesome Indies Seal of Approval Awarded IndiePENdents seal of approval. Few Are Chosen is the first book in the K'Barthan Series of dystopian humorous science fiction books. It is set in a contemporary dystopia, in a parallel reality but there is some futuristic technology. This book ends in a cliff hanger and for full enjoyment readers are strongly advised to read the series in order, continuing the story with The Wrong Stuff, K'Barthan Series: Part 2 (green cover) after reading this one. **** INTERVIEW WITH THE AUTHOR Q \u2013 What made you write this series? A \u2013 If you want the honest answer I wrote it for me. As a reader, I love British satire and humor (or humour). I love wit; funny epic fantasy series like the Discworld novels and comedic sci fi like Douglas Adams. I like sff and speculative fiction, I like adventure and action and a gripping tale that zips along quickly, I like genre mash ups and I love an angsty dystopian world. However, the best science fiction and fantasy stories, for me, are funny. I aim to write comedy in the tradition of all the great humorous British authors. I like to aim high. I wanted protagonists people could love and empathise with, mavericks, misfit characters, real people ... except they're not all people obviously, some of them are other alien (ish) species. This book is about misfit heroes and heroines winning the day, it\u2019s about good versus evil even when the good guys are on different sides. It's dystopian science fiction fantasy action - it's dystopia but it's comedy, it's sci-fi but it's planet-based. You'll find all sorts of quirky characters and interesting alien species: from 6ft Swamp Things with antennae to cute furry creatures like the Blurpons, with their fluffy ears, big button eyes and penchant for extreme violence. Oh ... and did I mention the flying car chases? Q \u2013 Do our readers have to read the K\u2019Barthan Series in order? A \u2013 Yes otherwise the character development \u2013 and some of the technology \u2013 will make less sense the books go in this order: - Unlucky Dip, K'Barthan Series: Prequel ** - Few Are Chosen, K'Barthan Series: Part 1 - this book ** - The Wrong Stuff, K'Barthan Series: Part 2 - One Man: No Plan, K'Barthan Series: Part 3 - Looking For Trouble, K'Barthan Series: Part 4 **** SIMILAR AUTHORS: Robert Rankin, C Gockel, Patty Jansen, JJ Greene, FJ Savage, Heide Goodey, EM Foner, Robert Asprin, the Stainless Steel Rat and Space Team series.

The combination makes from some interesting and humorous mysteries, and the witches are always at the center of the action!

The witches are forever cooking up new business opportunities like The Westwick Corners Inn, The Witching Post Bar and Grill, and of course, Pearl's Charm School, where witches go to unravel riddles, spin magic spells, and create their own witch mysteries. Too bad they are forever getting distracted because there are always strange things happening in Westwick Corners, from petty crime to murder. The West family has always been in Westwick Corners and always will be. They descend from a long line of witches who have inhabited Westwick Corners from the beginning. Witches who unlock mysteries, solve crime, and help those in need. They are collectively a kind of a witch of all trades, because pitching in--or is it witching in-- is what you do in a small town. Everyone helps out. Even Grandma Vi the ghost investigates and sleuths. But when everyone pulls together, it's not always in the same direction!

The West family has always been in Westwick Corners and always will be. They descend from a long line of witches who have inhabited Westwick Corners from the beginning. Witches who unlock mysteries, solve crime, and help those in need. They are collectively a kind of a witch of all trades, because pitching in--or is it witching in-- is what you do in a small town.

        "description": "'Benjamin Hardy is one of the leading voices on well-being and productivity. Willpower Doesn't Work is an insightful guide to help us thrive in today's world' Arianna Huffington If you're relying on willpower alone to help you lose weight, improve your relationships or achieve more at work, you're doomed to fail. The environment around us is far too powerful, stimulating, addicting and stressful to overcome it through sheer determination. Willpower, grit, being positive - basically, all the tools you've been told are the keys to creating lasting change in your life - are insufficient in this high-paced, information-overloaded world we live in. The only way to stop just surviving and learn to truly thrive in today's world is to proactively shape your environment. That's the premise of Willpower Doesn't Work, by organisational psychologist and Medium's most-read self-help guru Benjamin Hardy. Building on copious existing research, as well as his own experience of growing up in a broken family afflicted by addiction and drug use, Hardy explains how people can change their lives on every level by making small, impactful changes in their environment like: * Creating 'enriched environments' - using tougher challenges and self-imposed deadlines to force yourself to rise to the occasion. * Growing into your goals - using radical personal accountability to keep yourself on target and on track. * Becoming the teacher - stepping into a leadership role (even before you think you're ready) to accelerate your skills. * Rotating your environments - getting out of your rut by literally changing your physical surroundings throughout the day or week. From simple steps like removing things that conflict with your values from your environment (like junk food, junk media, even junk people), to incorporating new tools (like fasting or adding 'positive triggers' to your world), these lessons make it possible to consciously shape your surroundings so you can lead a more productive and happier life. Hardy leans on his own story of making the decision to foster three young children to illustrate how any shift, no matter how huge, can become 'the new normal' if you support that change with a productive environment.",

        "description": "This book pioneers evidence-based research on healthy aging through the application of self determination theory (SDT). Its uniqueness is located in the fact that to date, no other work has applied SDT to the empirical study of aging populations. The authors focus on how SDT drives healthy, successful and active aging, and note that the motivation factors underpinning healthy aging are often neglected, or altogether absent, in the existing literature. This edited volume is particularly timely given the expanding aging crisis in many North American, European and Asian contexts. The collection of chapters meets this challenge head-on in comparing these contexts vis-a-vis a broad international scope, and subsequent discussions on important specialty issues in aging, such as hearing and memory loss. The work offers global perspectives on aging, autonomy and associated life challenges, as well as factors relating to the sustainability of healthy aging in terms of physical and mental well-being. This book will be highly relevant to researchers in the SDT community, as well as specialists in aging and gerontology. It will also be of interest to lifespan psychologists and developmental psychologists.",

For those who would choose to embark or continue on the simple but often difficult path of being better, the author presents a remarkably clear and practical guide that can be of immense benefit to anyone who aspires to grow in living life more fully and authentically. Exercises and suggestions are provided, with special attention directed to a person's inner space where we are encouraged to locate and awaken the neglected or dormant resources present in every human being and apply them in the world. \"Being better\" refers to improvement, but not only at one level. It seems reasonable to focus on three: the material, mental, and transpersonal. These are presented and discussed sequentially, and these concepts should be applied practically in day-to-day life to learn their meaning and value. A series of fifty-nine process activities are included, exploring empirically and experientially the validity that learning and being better are actions, not merely ideas. At each step, these activities consider, refine, and validate notions of who and what we are and how to be better. By increments, we are led to explore and to immerse ourselves fully in life first our own, then the lives of others, and ultimately the source of life itself.",

        "description": "While abundant research has investigated time use, much less attention has been given to the cultural meanings attached to free time and what these may express with regard to conceptions of freedom and the self. In an attempt to fill this gap, Michelle Shir-Wise examines not only what people do in their free time, but also how they perceive, interpret and experience it, and in what way it relates to notions of happiness, freedom and the ideal self. Time, Freedom and the Self draws on contemporary theoretical debates concerning the relation between discourse, cultural repertoires, subjective meaning and agency, as well as literature around the sociology of leisure, to inform a unique interpretation of free time (\u201cdisciplined freedom\u201d), developed in the light of questionnaires and in-depth interviews with middle-class, middle-aged participants in suburban Israel.",

Drawing on global gender studies and feminist research, the author examines how \u2018woman\u2019 has been constructed socially, culturally, and politically throughout different historical periods and feminist movements. Case studies look at how women in different personal and professional settings construct, enact, and navigate their personas against a backdrop of shifting discourses on gender relations, continued patriarchal dominance, and western neoliberal capitalism. Chapters also delve into how women\u2019s personas are constructed online through activism and community building. The author examines the diversity, flexibility, and slipperiness of the ways being a woman is experienced and strategically performed. This book will be useful for scholars and students in Gender Studies, Sociology, Psychology, and Media Studies.",

In 1987, Charlie Whitfield's breakthrough concept of the child within\u2014that part of us which is truly alive, energetic, creative and fulfilled\u2014launched the inner child movement. Healing the Child Within describes how the inner child is lost to trauma and loss, and how by recovering it, we can heal the fear, confusion and unhappiness of adult life. Eighteen years and more than a million copies sold later, Healing the Child Within is a perennial selling classic in the field of psychology. And it is even more timely today than it was in 1987. Recent brain research, particularly on the effects of trauma on the brain of developing children, has supported Whitfield's intuitive understanding as a psychiatrist. About HCI Recovery Classics HCI's recovery backlist contains some of the most important and best-selling works in the recovery field. These books are still sought after today, selling more than 100,000 copies per year. Our new line of branded books features expanded editions of our top recovery titles, new introductions, updates on pertinent recent developments in the field, and contemporary new covers and packaging.",

        "description": "The three coeditors knew John Butterworth for many years and had worked closely with him on a number of research projects. We respected him as a valuable colleague and friend. We were greatly saddened by his untimely death. This book is an attempt to remember him. We dedicate the volume to John with thanks for the contributions he made to our research, to the Faculty of Commerce and Business Administration at the University of British Columbia, and to the accounting profession. This volume contains twelve invited papers on the general topic of the economic theory of information and contracts. We asked leading scholars who had known John to contribute papers. The response was very gratifying. The authors provided us with new strong research papers that should make a lasting contribution to the accounting and information economics research literature, and make us all proud to have put this volume together. The research papers in the volume are in three sections: information evaluation in multi person conte)l:ts; contracting in agencies under moral hazard; and contracting in agencies with private information. We begin part I with Jerry Feltham's review of John Butterworth's pioneering contributions to the accounting and information economics literature. This is followed by an introduction to the papers in the volume and the papers themselves.",

GOETHE Since the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), which are analysed in Part 1, are spe cialized agencies linked by special agreements with the United Nations, a few words about the UN and two of the other specialized agencies, the Food and Agriculture Organization and the International Labour Organization, are called for. This is followed by a short account of the Bank for International Settlements, which is also referred to in connection with the IMF and the IBRD. The rest of this introduction is devoted to some non-European attempts at economic integration (which have not yet been very successful) and to the regional development banks. 1. The United Nations (UN) The United Nations comprises 159 countries (September 1986) which have accepted the Charter of the United Nations, which was signed at San Francisco on 26 June 1945 by fifty-one states and came into force on 24 October 1945. The aims of the organization include the maintenance of peace and security, the promotion of better standards of living and the encouragement of economic and social progress for all nations by means of international cooperation. The principal organs of the UN are: The General Assembly The Security Council The Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) The Trusteeship Council The International Court of Justice The Secretariat.",

That was his plan, anyway, when he'd retired from his position as a counterintelligence officer for the Defense Intelligence Service branch of the government. Unfortunately, high-priced attorney Martin Van Pelham has other plans for the battle weary PI. Van Pelham's niece Karen (who he raised as his daughter) has gotten herself into some deep trouble, and Hardin's job is to make sure she stays alive to answer for it. The first problem he encounters is Karen's reluctance to cooperate with this plan, preferring instead to attack him with a camping hatchet. The next problem is a crooked drunk and abusive police officer named Randy Talon, who happens to be Karen's husband. Even with the help of Wendy, his bounty hunter wife, and Ron Craig, friend and ex-CIA agent, the case is already threatening to become dangerously hard to handle. This remarkably well-crafted story has the trademark qualities of superior detective mystery: deft plotting, lively dialogue, timely information, knowledgeable opinion, and acute commentary on the ways of the world. Private Heat is the beginning of a very exciting new series.",

Michael Lewin \u201chas brains and style\u201d\u2014and so does his Indy gumshoe, Albert Samson, so relaxed he doesn\u2019t even carry a gun. In these three mysteries collected in one volume, Samson uses his wits to solve some very seedy crimes (Los Angeles Times). Ask the Right Question: Private investigator Albert Samson gets a shake-up with his new client: sixteen-year-old Eloise Crystal is desperate to find her biological father. What the detective unearths is the kind of dirt that makes people do desperate things. Thrust into a moneyed clan of old secrets and killer deceptions, Samson discovers that the first lie may be Eloise\u2019s. The Way We Die Now: When Vietnam veteran Ralph Tomanek is charged with manslaughter, Samson believes there\u2019s more to the story. But why was a man with a history of PTSD hired as an armed guard in the first place? The answer is a dizzying case of blackmail that lands Samson on the wrong end of the gun. The Enemies Within: Samson\u2019s new client is Bennett Willson, a struggling writer looking for justice. It\u2019s a pretty glitzy case for the cheapest detective in Indianapolis: Strong-arm a big-time Broadway producer who allegedly stole Willson\u2019s play. Unfortunately, Willson proves to be as pure as the Indianapolis slush. What he wants is revenge. For Samson, finding out why could mean the final curtain call. The recipient of a Mystery Masters Award, a Raymond Chandler Society Award, and a Maltese Falcon Society Award, Michael Lewin, \u201cwrites with style and sensibility and wit . . .

        "description": "The goal of this book is to stimulate an awareness of a person's Authentic Self. For those who would choose to embark or continue on the simple but often difficult path of being better, the author presents a remarkably clear and practical guide that can be of immense benefit to anyone who aspires to grow in living life more fully and authentically. Exercises and suggestions are provided, with special attention directed to a person's inner space where we are encouraged to locate and awaken the neglected or dormant resources present in every human being and apply them in the world. \"Being better\" refers to improvement, but not only at one level. It seems reasonable to focus on three: the material, mental, and transpersonal. These are presented and discussed sequentially, and these concepts should be applied practically in day-to-day life to learn their meaning and value. A series of fifty-nine process activities are included, exploring empirically and experientially the validity that learning and being better are actions, not merely ideas. At each step, these activities consider, refine, and validate notions of who and what we are and how to be better. By increments, we are led to explore and to immerse ourselves fully in life first our own, then the lives of others, and ultimately the source of life itself.",

Issues of silence, the subjective feelings of opportunities, and culturally canalized feelings of \u201cbeing here\u201d or \u201cbeing influenced by others\" are all deep personal experiences that are rooted within the framework of cultural psychology. By bringing together the discourses of Dialogical Self Theory (DST) and Cultural Psychology of Semiotic Mediation for a new generation of researchers who address issues of this phenomenon, chapters aim to link phenomena-saturated empirical accounts with general theoretical innovations. In addition, the Brief studies socially relevant issues from the lenses of Cultural Psychology. Topics featured in this Brief include: Globalization and its effect on identity and personal experiences. The subjective nature of opportunities. Migrating identities across generations. Serious illness and its influence on communication. Deep Experiencing will be of interest to researchers, professors, and graduate students in the fields of psychology, cognitive psychology, medicine, anthropology, social work, and aesthetics.",

Today media are part of our world and therefore play an important role in the formulations of our identities or constructions of self. In a truly postmodern mode, Constructing the Self in a Mediated World not only brings together the usually segregated areas of interpersonal and mass communication but also incorporates works from scholars in sociology, psychology, and women's studies as well. Each essay examines our understanding of self in a different context of mediated culture within a specific framework of interpretive theories such as critical theory, social constructionist theory, and feminism. This volume provides insights into issues of self and identity in contemporary mediated culture. Designed for advanced students and experienced researchers in communication (both media and interpersonal), sociology, psychology, and women's studies. Constructing the Self in a Mediated World raises important questions and contributes greatly to its field.",

        "description": "When a mother and her young daughter are found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning in a car parked at an overlook off a Hollywood freeway, it appears they are victims of a culturally driven parent-child suicide. LAPD Detective Howard Drew faces his first real test as a new lead homicide investigator as he follows a twisted trail of clues to find the truth in his most challenging case yet. The Pendulum is the second novel featuring Detective Howard Drew in a new fast-paced police procedural series set in Los Angeles that crime fiction fans won\u2019t want to miss. When a 3 A.M. callout sends West Bureau homicide Detective Howard Drew to an overlook above Hollywood Bowl, he finds an Asian woman and her six-year-old daughter dead inside a vehicle with a garden hose running from the exhaust pipe into a rear window. The initial evidence points to the cultural practice called oyako shinju in Japan, a ritual child-parent suicide committed after the woman was shamed by her husband\u2019s adultery. And as the truth emerges, it becomes more and more apparent that things may not be as they appear. Drew and his new partner, Detective Cici Ruiz, suspect they are being misled by someone very deceptive... very cunning... and very deadly who staged the scene to look like oyako shinju. As the detectives dig to uncover the truth, the pendulum of opinion swings back and forth. Was it child-parent suicide? Or was it a double-homicide staged to throw the homicide investigators off track? Crime fiction author Larry Darter has created a dark, fast-paced suspense thriller filled with stark realism that cuts to the very core of the crimes real life LAPD homicide detectives face. Once you start reading, there\u2019s no turning back.",

He\u2019s dealing drugs for a crime syndicate in Sydney and saving for a house by the sea. But what does he think life is, a fairy tale? As the syndicate puts pressure on him to fill the shoes of his murdered boss, Murdoch is cornered by an equally formidable foe: the Australian Tax Of\ufb01ce demanding an explanation for his sizeable cash income. Murdoch spins a beautiful lie, telling tax inspector, Hannah Simms, he\u2019s a private detective. When Simms asks him to investigate the mystery of her niece's disappearance, Murdoch grabs what he thinks is a golden opportunity to outrun the syndicate. But his arrival in the missing girl's small coastal home town causes an unexpected stir and the reluctant PI soon realises his troubles are only just beginning...

Ayers was from a wealthy Chicago family, and was found dead in Lake Michigan, in the water near his luxury boat. Cass begins digging and is surprised to learn that Tim Ayers was terminally ill.

        "description": "Already an international hit, a sly, sizzling mystery\u2014the first in a sensational crime series\u2014set in the Italian Alps, reminiscent of the works of Andrea Camilleri, D. A. Mishani, Donna Leon, and Henning Mankell. Getting into serious trouble with the wrong people, deputy prefect of police Rocco Schiavone is exiled to Aosta, a small, touristy alpine town far from his beloved Rome. The sophisticated and crotchety Roman despises mountains, snow, and the provincial locals as much as he disdains his superiors and their petty rules. But he loves solving crimes. When a mangled body has been discovered on a ski run above Champoluc, Rocco immediately faces his first challenge\u2014identifying the victim, a complex procedure complicated by his ignorance of the customs, dialect, and history of his new home. Proud and undaunted, Rocco makes his way among the ski runs, mountain huts, and aerial tramways, meeting ski instructors, Alpine guides, the hardworking, enigmatic folk of Aosta, and a few beautiful locals eager to give him a warm welcome. It won't be easy, this mountain life, especially with a corpse or two in the mix. But then there's nothing that makes Rocco feel more at home than an investigation. An insightful observer of human nature, Antonio Manzini writes with sly humor and a dash of irony, and introduces an irresistible hero\u2014a fascinating blend of swagger, machismo, and vulnerability\u2014in a colorful and atmospheric crime mystery series that is European crime fiction at its best.",

        "description": "Can Kat Harper solve this case without getting burned? Kat Harper's morning walk is cut short when a nearby house goes up in flames. The traumatic incident leaves the Jefferson family homeless and devastated. Worse yet, the fire appears to be the result of an arson attack, spurring everyone to question who would do such a thing. The more Kat learns, the more it seems the Jeffersons made a dangerous enemy. Could it be the estranged relative who finally decided to exact revenge over an unfair inheritance? A determined thief looking to cover up their criminal tracks? Or was it someone else entirely? While Kat attempts to identify the guilty party, her tortoiseshell cat Matty has her paws full comforting the two youngest Jeffersons. But as Kat digs deeper, she might be the one who needs Matty's solace. It doesn't take long before another possible culprit emerges. And when it turns out this new suspect has personal ties to someone Kat cares for, the gumshoe detective might soon wish she had skipped the amateur sleuthing just this once. All of the Cozy Cat Caper Mystery books can be enjoyed as standalones but will be better appreciated as part of the series.

        "description": "Enjoy This Contemporary Small Town Amateur Sleuth Murder Mystery Detective Helen Parr is recovering from being shot in Leslie Williams\u2019 basement and is anxious to get back to work. With the police department in the hands of Acting Chief Detective Dan Conway, Father Tom Greer is determined that his fiance follows her doctor\u2019s orders and rests. All that\u2019s needed for this to happen is for life to be quiet and peaceful. But this is Myerton, and this town nestled in the mountains of Western Maryland is far from quiet and peaceful. First comes the murder of Bethany Grable, owner of The Painted Lotus art gallery and old friend of Father Tom. Dan\u2019s convinced she was the victim of a robbery gone wrong. Father Tom, on the other hand, is not so sure. Then comes the wave of overdose deaths of young students at Myer College. Someone is selling fentanyl at prices college kids can afford. They\u2019re all art majors, and all of them happen to have had pieces displayed in Bethany\u2019s gallery. Coincidence? Or is there a connection between the ODs and Bethany Grable\u2019s murder? And if so, what is the connection? Father Tom decides to try to find out for himself who killed his old friend and why. But doing so could put the life of a young man in danger, and irreparably harm his friendship with Dan. Along the way, Father Tom learns that Helen wasn\u2019t the only person wounded in that basement . . . The Purloined Painting is the seventh book in The Father Tom Mysteries series, a contemporary small town mystery series. It features Father Tom Greer, a Catholic Priest who is also an amateur sleuth in the tradition of Father Brown.

        "description": "A pair of imaginative science fiction story collections from the #1 New York Times\u2013bestselling author of Spartacus, Freedom Road, and the Immigrants saga. Over his long and illustrious career, New York Times\u2013bestselling author and prolific novelist Howard Fast proved himself a master of any literary genre, from historical fiction in Spartacus to family generational drama in his bestselling Immigrants saga. Although his output in fantasy and science fiction is relatively modest, these two short story collections, reminiscent of classic Twilight Zone episodes, demonstrate that Fast\u2019s imagination knew no boundaries. The General Zapped an Angel: Nearly forty years after the publication of his first story, \u201cWrath of Purple,\u201d in the science fiction magazine Amazing Stories, Fast returned to the genre with a set of nine supremely entertaining tales. In this collection, a Vietnam general shoots down what appears to be an angel, a man sells his soul to the devil for a copy of the next day\u2019s Wall Street Journal, and a group of alien beings bestow a mouse with human thought and emotion. \u201cThese stories amply display Fast\u2019s considerable gifts as a writer\u2014his clear, concise, often elegant prose, his sense of humor, his gift of sympathetic imagination, and sheer talent as a storyteller.\u201d \u2014Tangent A Touch of Infinity: This follow-up to The General Zapped an Angel offers thirteen brisk and engrossing science fiction stories. In \u201cThe Hoop,\u201d a scientist builds a portal to an unknown destination, which the mayor of New York City hijacks to use as a garbage dump until the location\u2019s surprising\u2014and hilarious\u2014revelation. And in \u201cThe Egg,\u201d set three thousand years in the future, a research team discovers an egg, something they have never seen before, cryogenically frozen in a nuclear bunker. \u201cFast, a master of economy . . . spins his stories quickly and most effectively.\u201d \u2014Associated Press",

        "description": "\"What's Next,\" by Geoffrey Keane, is a science fiction novel with a setting of one- thousand years into the future. The author projects that eventually, many of us will have our own personal android servant; manufactured from synthetic bone, muscle and skin; having a computer for a brain; and this, he also projects, will exponentially change the degree and intensity to which we will interact, and receive much greater assistance from the computer technology of the distant future. How many years do you imagine life expectancy will expand to, many generations from now? This author's projections might surprise you; some of what Keane has imagined to eventually play out, may expand your own horizons, in terms of considering what we might be heading towards in the future, provided things keep developing in the directions that they currently seem to be, in today's world; not only technologically speaking, but in terms of societal norms, and the legal system. Keane also offers his imagination of what the future political structure will ultimately evolve into, in the US, and around the world in general; and this scenario offers a keen perspective on the long-run playing out of current trends relating to liberal, versus conservative ideals. One primary focus and emphasis that this story centers around, is the author's insights regarding the impact of societal norms surrounding sexuality and sexual offense; and his projections of what might ultimately come to pass, if things continue to trend in the direction we seem to be moving in, in the US, along these lines. This entertaining novel is an imaginative tale encompassing an expansive, worldly view, on a range of issues; from morality to politics, to finance, to addiction; sharing a broader perspective on humanity in general. - Blurb: This is a science fiction story with a setting of a thousand years into the future.

        "description": "Groundbreaking study of science fiction's relation to colonialism and imperialism This is the first full-length study of emerging Anglo-American science fiction's relation to the history, discourses, and ideologies of colonialism and imperialism. Nearly all scholars and critics of early science fiction acknowledge that colonialism is an important and relevant part of its historical context, and recent scholarship has emphasized imperialism's impact on late Victorian Gothic and adventure fiction and on Anglo-American popular and literary culture in general. John Rieder argues that colonial history and ideology are crucial components of science fiction's displaced references to history and its engagement in ideological production. He proposes that the profound ambivalence that pervades colonial accounts of the exotic \"other\" establishes the basic texture of much science fiction, in particular its vacillation between fantasies of discovery and visions of disaster. Combining original scholarship and theoretical sophistication with a clearly written presentation suitable for students as well as professional scholars, this study offers new and innovative readings of both acknowledged classics and rediscovered gems. Includes discussion of works by Edwin A. Abbott, Edward Bellamy, Edgar Rice Burroughs, John W. Campbell, George Tomkyns Chesney, Arthur Conan Doyle, H. Rider Haggard, Edmond Hamilton, W. H. Hudson, Richard Jefferies, Henry Kuttner, Alun Llewellyn, Jack London, A. Merritt, Catherine L. Moore, William Morris, Garrett P. Serviss, Mary Shelley, Olaf Stapledon, and H. G. Wells.",

        "description": "500 years after the Galactic Empire's collapse, the 427th Light Maintenance Battalion of the Imperial Space Marines stubbornly hold onto their mission, training to repair starships that never come. Their equipment gradually wears out and to all outward appearance, they seem to be primitive savages, living by hunting and farming. When a coup removes Colonel Marcus Harris, commander of the maintenance battalion, in favor of his executive officer, the colonel and a loyal second lieutenant, Kurt Dixon, are jailed. When Dixon escapes, he hides in a battle suit to avoid detection. He accidentally activates it and is propelled into outer space. There, he is rescued by a scout of the new Galactic Protectorate...a ramshackle, barely-functioning organization whose leaders are fighting amongst themselves. The Galactic Protectorate, despite its name, has lost most of the technical expertise to do even routine maintenance on their own equipment. Both sides have something the other needs. But can they possibly work together? And if they do, will it be war -- or the start of a new Galactic Empire? Theodore Cogswell's classic science fiction novella is available in ebook form for the first time in more than a decade!",

The good kind, of course\u201d (BuzzFeed) from the Jordan Peele of horror literature, Stephen Graham Jones. \u201cSome girls just don\u2019t know how to die\u2026\u201d Shirley Jackson meets Friday the 13th in My Heart Is a Chainsaw, written by the New York Times bestselling author of The Only Good Indians Stephen Graham Jones, called \u201ca literary master\u201d by National Book Award winner Tananarive Due and \u201cone of our most talented living writers\u201d by Tommy Orange. Alma Katsu calls My Heart Is a Chainsaw \u201ca homage to slasher films that also manages to defy and transcend genre.\u201d On the surface is a story of murder in small-town America. But beneath is its beating heart: a biting critique of American colonialism, Indigenous displacement, and gentrification, and a heartbreaking portrait of a broken young girl who uses horror movies to cope with the horror of her own life. Jade Daniels is an angry, half-Indian outcast with an abusive father, an absent mother, and an entire town that wants nothing to do with her. She lives in her own world, a world in which protection comes from an unusual source: horror movies\u2026especially the ones where a masked killer seeks revenge on a world that wronged them. And Jade narrates the quirky history of Proofrock as if it is one of those movies. But when blood actually starts to spill into the waters of Indian Lake, she pulls us into her dizzying, encyclopedic mind of blood and masked murderers, and predicts exactly how the plot will unfold. Yet, even as Jade drags us into her dark fever dream, a surprising and intimate portrait emerges\u2026a portrait of the scared and traumatized little girl beneath the Jason Voorhees mask: angry, yes, but also a girl who easily cries, fiercely loves, and desperately wants a home. A girl whose feelings are too big for her body. My Heart Is a Chainsaw is her story, her homage to horror and revenge and triumph.",

This book engages with the research of prominent scholars across the humanities to explore the presence, role and function of horror in videogames, and in doing so it demonstrates how videogames enter discussion on horror and offer a unique, radical space that horror is particularly suited to fill. The topics covered include the construction of stories in videogames, the role of the monster and, of course, how death is treated as a learning tool and as a facet of horror.",

Divided into sections that explore the origins and evolution of horror fiction, the recurrent themes that can be seen in horror, and ways of understanding horror through literary and cultural theory, the text analyses why horror is so compelling, and how we should interpret its presence in literature. Chapters explore historical horror aspects including ancient mythology, medieval writing, drama, chapbooks, the Gothic novel, and literary Modernism and trace themes such as vampires, children and animals in horror, deep dark forests, labyrinths, disability, and imperialism. Considering horror via postmodern theory, evolutionary psychology, postcolonial theory, and New Materialism, this handbook investigates issues of gender and sexuality, race, censorship and morality, environmental studies, and literary versus popular fiction.",

        "description": "This book is an exploration of the material conditions of the production of African literature. Drawing on the archives of Heinemann\u2019s African Writers Series, it highlights the procedures, relationships, demands, ideologies, and counterpressures engendered by the publication of three major authors: Chinua Achebe, Wole Soyinka, and Ngugi wa Thiongo. As a study of the history and techniques of African literary texts, this book advances a theory of reciprocity of effects - what it terms 'auto-heteronomy' - to describe the dynamic of formalist activism by which texts anticipate and shape the forces of literary production in advance. It serves as a departure from the 'death of the author' thesis by reconsidering the role of the author in African literature and culture industry, as well as the influence of African publics on writers\u2019 aesthetic choices, and on the overall processes of production. This work is a major contribution to African literary history, literary criticism, and book history.",

        "description": "Who is more important: the reader, or the writer? Originally published in French in 1966, Pierre Macherey's first and most famous work, \"A Theory of Literary Production\" dared to challenge perceived wisdom, and quickly established him as a pivotal figure in literary theory. In this provocative work, Macherey puts the focus as much on the reader as the writer, stating that the very act of reading is a form of production in its own right, generating interpretation and meanings which are beyond the control of the author. Part of the birth of a whole new branch of post-structuralist theory, Macherey's work also influenced a new generation of critics among them Jacques Derrida, his contemporary, and Terry Eagleton. His ideas have also led some observers to claim that he announced the death of the author fully two years before Roland Barthes' famous essay.",

Bell's influential essays on nineteenth-century American writers\u2014originally written for such landmark projects as The Columbia Literary History of the United States and The Cambridge History of American Literature\u2014are gathered here with a major new essay on Richard Wright. Throughout, Bell revisits issues of genre with an eye toward the unexpected details of authors' lives, and invites us to reconsider the hidden functions that terms such as \"romanticism\" and \"realism\" served for authors and their critics. Whether tracing the demands of the market or the expectations of readers, Bell examines the intimate relationship between literary production and culture; each essay closely links the milieu in which American writers worked with the trajectory of their storied careers.",

While flexibility and creativity are in the DNA of many startups in China, major players like Xiaomi and Alibaba have also emerged as global giants, challenging established global competitors. The authors of this book show that these companies are crossing various boundaries \u2013 between cultures, mindsets, and perspectives. At the same time, Western companies entering Asian markets face challenges that are very different from those on their home turf. This book addresses the needs of current and future managers doing business in Asia, who need to understand the individual, social and business challenges that can arise from crossing boundaries. The respective case studies provide essential insights on how several Asian companies have made impressive strides towards becoming established players; how the revival of local brands and growing pride in local products has become a major challenge for global competition; how the need to actively practice corporate social responsibility in Asian markets is currently challenging many companies; and how the need for individual and team coaching among the members of management to support a company\u2019s development has grown tremendously, calling for new solutions.",

        "description": "This edited volume explores the influence of role modelling as a process in the workplace; in particular, whether it can aid career development, offer psycho-social support, and provide the motivation and means to achieve goals. Chapters examine whether the dynamics of personal identification and self-belief can affect the way that role models are chosen, placing emphasis on geographical diversity and cultural aspects. By including studies of gender and followership in both American and Indian settings, the scholars and practitioners who contribute to this collection outline key aspects of role modelling, and its effect as a developmental tool in the workplace, from the perspective of the individual and organisations. This book is a valuable resource for academics interested in organisations, management, and diversity, as well as practitioners and policy-makers involved in leadership programmes, who will find its collection of both theoretical and empirical findings extremely useful.",

A death rocks the Gulf Coast town of Port Leo, Texas. Beach-bum-turned-judge Whit Mosley is summoned to a yacht where the black-sheep son of a senator lies dead. Was it suicide, fueled by a family tragedy? Or did an obsessed killer use the dead man as a pawn in a twisted game? When Whit defies political pressure and conducts an inquest, he and Detective Claudia Salazar expose a nest of drug lords, con artists, and power-hungry sharks - all out for blood. With their careers -- and their lives -- at stake, Whit and Claudia must unearth a lethal trail of passion and deceit that lies buried not in the warm sands of Port Leo but in the icy recesses of the human heart.",

        "description": "LEGACY OF THE GENERAL - Part 2 - A RELUCTANT WHITE KNIGHT novel - Volume 4 Reviewed by the Editorial Board, The Columbia Review of Books & Films \u201cLegacy of the General,\u201d the fourth installment in T.W. Anderson\u2019s \u201cA Reluctant White Knight\u201d series, pulls the hero, Tom Rowter, and his wife, Sunny, into a complicated conflict between powerful forces and launches them on a hazardous mission to fulfill the last wish of an admired friend (the General). Some time ago, when reviewing the first volume in T.W. Anderson\u2019s \u201cA Reluctant White Knight\u201d series, we had this to say: \u201cIt combines the best ingredients of the \u201cTexas Rangers\u201d genre fiction, but with highly contemporary suspense, which is further enriched with themes of green energy, aviation and technology. The lead character, Tom Rowter, is a solid anti-hero, a toned-down version of Clint Eastwood at his best. He tells the story in the first person, matter of fact, no hype or showoff (well, maybe a reserved touch of bravado\u2026). He\u2019s cool, aggressive (or even deadly, when necessary), and delivers it all with humor. He clearly has a big heart, which carries a good chunk of pain and guilt, and he can handle a gun. In other words, he\u2019s a good character, someone you would definitely want to spend more time with, literarily speaking.\u201d With the fourth novel in the series, Mr. Anderson maintains the remarkable qualities of his creation, while fleshing out the main characters, expanding the family circle, and revealing new aspects of this evolving saga. \u201cLegacy of the General\u201d picks up a short time after the events of \u201cSeascape\u2019s Aground!\u201d (Vol. 3). The story begins with a few scenes that give the reader\u2014even a new reader\u2014a sure footing in what\u2019s happening in the lives of Tom and Sunny. Meanwhile, a mysterious outfit gears up to take violent action in order to pilfer possession of \u2018an item,\u201d which happened to be on its way to Tom posthaste, courtesy of his now-deceased friend. Soon, the suspense rises and bad things start to happen. Mixing in the successful ingredients that made the previous volumes so enjoyable, the author adds in legal wrangling, government conspiracies, IRS and CIA shenanigans, a former U.S. president, and a good measure of sprightly romance and lively action. As before, Tom Rowter, with the conflicted yet incredibly gutsy Sunny, is determined to do the right thing, come hell or high water\u2014or such other bad things as one might expect, either on the ground or in the air. In summary, \u201cLegacy of the General\u201d fulfills the promise of the series, delivering an authentic setting and great action with a lively cast of flesh-and-blood characters, engaged in real-world relationships and embroiled in a risky crisis that gets resolved through the hero\u2019s courage, integrity, and thrilling exploits. The ending, when it comes, is surprising and satisfying.

Police Lieutenant Viktor Slutsky is sent in to investigate. So, too, is KGB officer Nik Tsensky. They begin their investigations unbeknownst to each other, but quickly find themselves mystified about developments caused by the other. Thus begins a comedy of very dangerous errors as the two crisscross Europe, Russia, and the Ukraine, catalysts in a bizarre battle between the Russian and Ukrainian secret services. What ensues is simultaneously hilarious, tragic, and suspenseful, with a fascinating cast of characters who would seem absurd if they weren\u2019t so compelling: a larger-than-life hitman, a deaf-and-dumb blonde, and a turtle. Then there\u2019s the gun that shoots backwards... And as the two faithful investigators find themselves to be pawns in a story of post-Soviet collapse, it becomes\u2014as usual in the work of this modern Russian master\u2014an inspiring tale of resilience against the dark forces of the day.",

Llyr masquerades as a marine biologist and signs on with a firm whose mission is to save the oceans, but his boss has been possessed by ancient evil that wants the whales dead. Desperate, Llyr returns to the sea for answers, but only finds more problems. Staring into the maw of his own destruction brands him, changes him irrevocably, and takes his choices away, but he can\u2019t give up.

Neither vampires nor werewolves, her kind is something in between, creatures with human appearances but monstrous urges for violence, flesh and blood. She never chose to become a N\u00ebphyr or a Queen. But this is her fate and she has no choice but to accept it. Her already complicated reign becomes even more difficult when intruders infiltrate New Hell and nearly destroy the Reserve, the place where preys are kept. With famine near, the N\u00ebphyr are growing more and more bestial and want bloodshed worthy of the beginning of the Ex Tenebris epoch, when all the Creatures of Darkness revealed themselves to humanity in the most brutal way possible. The only one Nemesis can count on is Nathanael, her lover who would prefer their relationship was more than a casual affair. But a long-lasting relationship isn\u2019t something she can offer with the scars of her past still fresh in her mind and the possibility of a war looming on the horizon. Nemesis must discover who is behind the attack and end this crisis. For if she fails, death will come for everyone, including Nathanael and herself. *Author's note: this book contains sexual situations, strong violence and language.

For the last seven years she's been collecting a bracelet of black beads up her wrist, magical IOUs for favors she's received. Only death or repayment will fulfill the obligations. Only then will the beads disappear. Everyone knows that if you need a favor, you go to the Bargainer to make it happen. He's a man who can get you anything you want... at a price. And everyone knows that sooner or later he always collects. But for one of his clients, he's never asked for repayment. Not until now. When Callie finds the Bargainer in her room, a grin on his lips and a twinkle in his eye, she knows things are about to change. At first, it's just a chaste kiss - a single bead's worth - and a promise for more. For the Bargainer, it's more than just a matter of rekindling an old romance. Something is happening in the Otherworld. Fae warriors are going missing one by one. Only the women are returned, each in a glass casket, a child clutched to their breast. And then there are the whispers among the slaves, whispers of an evil that's been awoken. If the Bargainer has any hope to save his people, he'll need the help of the siren he spurned long ago. Only, his foe has a taste for exotic creatures, and Callie just happens to be one.",

        "description": "In this dark epic fantasy that crackles with sinister sorcery and eldritch energy, ancient evil and prophecy collide as an unsuspecting medieval kingdom, still recovering from a hellish oppression that devastated the land a thousand years earlier, is about to be plunged once more into nightmare. The end of the world is nigh! Sharn is the insane descendant of a people who were once forcibly interbred with demons from an extra-dimensional netherworld that's separated from ours by the thinnest of sorcerous veils... ...a veil that was once torn asunder in an accident of sorcery, opening a rent through which the demons poured and overran the land,enslaving the population... ...demons that were eventually driven back beyond the veil by a noble wizard who foretold that one day the demons would return, and so would he. Evil stirs in the land, and demons covet the world of mortals! Captured by knights who have hunted the hybrid demonspawn to near-extinction, Sharn is imprisoned in the dank depths of the royal castle, where he becomes caught up in the nefarious plans of a scheming king's chancellor who is secretly practicing the darkest of magical arts. The queen has just given birth to a son, kicking off the fulfillment of ancient prophecy. Sharn, somehow granted a reprieve from his madness by the newborn prince, kidnaps the royal heir and escapes the castle. They wait impatiently behind a wall that is about to be torn down by black sorcery! And the hunt begins, as Sharn flees across a countryside where every hand is turned against him, heading toward destiny. Now, a king\u2019s evil chancellor schemes to reopen the Veil and once again unleash the demons. The world\u2019s only hope of salvation is an insane boy, himself the descendant of demonic/human hybrids, and the newborn baby he\u2019s kidnapped. keywords: dark fantasy, epic fantasy, demons, mutants, sorcery, wizards, kings and queens, novel",

        "description": "Ivan King is an Award Winning and Best Selling Author of over 30 books. His #1 Book on Amazon, Breakfast With Jesus, has become a major success internationally. Mr. King was born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 1977, though his stay in Rio was to be short lived. Adopted from an orphanage, he was raised in Ipatinga's, Valley of Steel. His favorite author is Hemingway; yet his favorite book, is Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath. When he is not writing or reading, he plays chess and the guitar. When Ivan was eight, he read his first book, Judy Blume's Superfudge and the rest is history. That's the story behind how the passion for reading began; how it ends...has yet to be written. Currently, he is working on a couple dozen writing projects and turning some of his novels into screenplays. Ivan\u2019s first published work, Valley of Steel, is a Fiction Novel loosely based on his life growing up in the favelas, or slums, of Brazil. Favorite quote: \u201cIn life, incredible things happen and unforgettable moments do exist; but nothing compares to having been loved by you, and though you rest in peace, I will miss and love you always.\u201d",

        "description": "Since the 1970s, the practice of financing major private and public sector capital-intensive projects has shifted to an ever-greater reliance on private funding sources, as opposed to direct financing through the issuance of corporate or government bonds. In the 1990s, these financing practices have undergone further changes with the increasing globalization of capital markets, the growth of derivative instruments, and the rapid increase in information technology that enhances cash-management practices. Today's project financing market is increasingly using sophisticated capital market, bank and agency financing mechanisms as well as using derivative instruments for asset and liability management. Thus, financial market innovations are bringing the once separate fields of project financing and international finance more closely together. This is the first book to treat both topics as an interrelated whole, for contemporary project financing cannot be fully understood without a good working knowledge of the international financial markets that have developed the various financing techniques and funding sources being used. The book provides an in-depth description of cross-border project financing as a technique for financing capital-intensive projects, as well as an overview of certain financing and derivative instruments currently available in the global financial markets. The first part of the book provides an overview of certain funding and derivative instruments currently used in the international financial markets, including a general overview of financial innovations that have occurred in recent decades. Topics covered include an introduction to the syndicated Euro-credit market; an overview of various marketable debt securities actively used in the international financial markets; an introduction to depositary receipt as an innovative way of raising cross-border equity capital; an elaboration of the derivative instruments most commonly used in the project financing arena, including interest rate, currency and commodity swaps; and finally an overview of banks' off-balance sheet activities as a critical driving force for the participation of banks in the international financial and derivative markets. The second part of the book provides an in-depth analysis of project financing that concentrates on the financier's perspective. Topics covered include a general overview of the project financing industry; a step-by-step description of a typical cross-border project finance transaction; a description of the main characteristics and advantages of project financing as opposed to more traditional corporate lending practices; an overview of appraisal techniques for assessing project financing; a comprehensive analysis of the different risk management techniques used in project financing for reducing, distributing and hedging risks; and a brief overview of certain limited-resource financing schemes. The book includes a special focus on the various stages of the risk management process for project financing, elaborating on the different stages of risk identification, risk assessment, risk reduction, risk distribution and hedging and insurance. The authors also provide a comprehensive glossary of terms relating to international finance and project financing. This book will fulfill the need for an essential text on project financing as well as a professional reference guide.",

The introduction argues that though there may be perceived disadvantages in investing in Vietnam, there are a number of benefits as well, such as the country's openness to trade and foreign direct investment, the increasing ease of doing business there and the dynamism of the economy. The book then provides an overview of Vietnam's economic policy since 1975, covering reunification, attempts at a command economy, and finally renovation under Doi Moi Policy. Further chapters cover the expansion of the private sector, interest in foreign investment, and the peculiarities of marketing and finance in Vietnam. As an edited volume with chapters written by Vietnamese scholars across economics, history, and business, this book is critical reading for researchers studying Vietnam and other Asian economies and for businesses interested in expanding into that market.",

        "description": "International Economics is unique despite the existence of numerous books of the same title. It is true that no one volume can capture the entire state of the art of the subject, but individuals can apply their own perspectives to identify crucial issues in the development of the field. Therefore, rather than instructions to prepare \"surveys\" of subfields within international economics, the contributors to this book were informed as follows: Your essay should present an affirmative but constructively critical look at your subject. It is not meant to be a survey. Rather, your task is to pinpoint crucial areas of development, to offer a critical evaluation of what's going on in the field and where it might go. Your contribution would be your own personal statement of how you see things. It should be written at the professional level. Beyond these general guidelines, you may develop your essay as you see fit. How much of \"international economics\" should be assigned to each author and how many contributions the book should have, required careful consideration. Traditionally, international economics has been divided into pure theory and monetary theory, suggesting a simple division of the field; but this dichotomy has been overturned by the emergence of litera ture that overlaps both theories. An opposite approach would have been to separate international economics into twelve to fifteen areas, each with a contributor. This procedure divides the field into too many parts and, consequently, overlapping threads of development would be ignored.",

        "description": "Cape Town, South Africa, 7 Sept. 2016 - 8 Sept. 2016. Theme: Sustainable economies in the information economy. Purpose: To share the quality academic papers presented at the International Conference on Business and Management Dynamics (ICBMD) held from 7 to 8 September 2016 at African Pride Crystal Hotel and Spa in Cape Town. As grey literature, the proceedings are the contributions made by researchers at the conference and are considered the written record of the work that was presented to fellow conference delegates. Methodology: The methodology used varies from researcher to researcher but are suitable for the studies conducted. Thus, on the one hand, studies that were subjective in nature used the interpretive paradigm, where the qualitative approach adopted made used of the interview method to collect data. On the other hand, studies that were objectively inclined adopted the positivist philosophy and used survey questionnaires to collect data. However, there were some academic papers which used mixed methodology because of the nature of the study. Whatever methodology used adhered to the ethos of the philosophies underpinning the methodology. Contribution made to scholarship: The articles come from individual researchers and each article in the proceedings is unique. Mostly, there is no general argument leading from one contribution to the next. However, it is interesting to note that in the area of economic performance it was evident that real exchange rate and net foreign direct investment contribute more towards innovations in economic growth. With regard to human capital development, papers presented evidence that there exists a definite need to explore the phenomenon of personal branding as limited scientific academic research has been done within the field of personal branding or on elements of the topic. Thus, the outcome argues that personal branding has an influence on leadership style which in turn impacts on organisational performance and related hygiene factors. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that current methods or strategies for enforcing institutionalisation of knowledge sharing within an organisation have not been successful, and, as such, new strategies are needed to reinforce efforts to nurture and invigorate the institutionalisation of knowledge sharing within an organisation. With regard to technology and big data impact on organisational performance, it was evident that system performance, memory consumption and CPU utilisation can be used as criteria to compare and evaluate big data technologies to improve organisational performance. Most of the articles' contribution reemphasised technology education and training as a means of digitising business and improving effectiveness. Target audience: The target readership is academic researchers and business leaders who require access to the latest developments in the fields of economics, information management, business, education, development studies, social sciences and technology. It is also for policymakers and other stakeholders who need a better understanding of the impact of new developments on existing policies and regulations for their review or amendment.",

        "description": "Orio Giarini The \"Geneva Association\" (International Association for the Study of Risk and Insurance Economics) was founded in 1973. The main goal was to stimulate and organize objective research in the field of risk, uncertainty, and insurance, in a world in which such issues were clearly becoming of greater and greater relevance for all economic actors. This was a pioneer ing effort, especially as economic theory and the teaching of economics were still anchored to the key notion of general equilibrium under an assumption of certainty. Thus, we had to start our work almost from scratch. One of the first initiatives was to bring together in Geneva, in June of 1973, all the academics in Europe already involved in risk and insurance economics. We found eight from five different countries who never had met before. This seminar chaired by Raymond Barre, the first president of The Geneva Association, was the first of an annual series that became known as the seminar of \"The European Group of Risk and Insurance Economists.\" Since then more than 100 economists from most European countries as well as participants from two other continents and in particular from the United States have taken part in this seminar.",

        "description": "Entrepreneurship is challenging, whatever your background, in the current science- and technology-driven Western world. However, unlike traditionally dominant, native-born, white male entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley and elsewhere, those who face greater hurdles blocking their path to success primarily come from marginalized and minority groups, both real and self-perceived\u2014including immigrants, refugees, women, blacks, Hispanics, and Asians. Despite their potential to innovate and add value in the global marketplace, they persistently struggle, or fail, because they lack the requisite code-breaking skills. This book helps these underdog entrepreneurs acquire those skills with actionable advice to achieve and sustain success. It proposes a framework that pinpoints what the author calls the outsider problem\u2014that is, situations in which individuals are primarily disadvantaged because they lack access to networks that facilitate superior learning and performance outcomes. He completes the framework by incorporating personal qualities and strategies that can solve this problem. Along the way, Morgan distills insights and evidence from multiple fields, combined with a fresh look at the familiar stories of initially marginalized business leaders, such as Indra Nooyi, Jack Ma, Hilary Devey and Mike Lazaridis. He also shares the less known, but equally inspiring stories of others. This book will help readers thrive while transcending their underdog status.",

But first, it seems appropriate to ask some questions. Why are you here? What is your personal purpose in life? Why are you doing what you are doing? What brought you to this profession?

        "description": "The book that topped the international online poll held in Agatha Christie's 125th birthday year to discover which of her 80 crime books was the world's favourite. 1939. Europe teeters on the brink of war. Ten strangers are invited to Soldier Island, an isolated rock near the Devon coast. Cut off from the mainland, with their generous hosts Mr and Mrs U.N. Owen mysteriously absent, they are each accused of a terrible crime. When one of the party dies suddenly they realise they may be harbouring a murderer among their number. The 10 strangers include a reckless playboy, a troubled Harley Street doctor, a formidable judge, an uncouth detective, an unscrupulous mercenary, a God-fearing spinster, two restless servants, a highly decorated general and an anxious secretary. One by one they are picked off. Who will survive? And who is the killer? Copies of an ominous nursery rhyme hang in each room, the murders mimicking the awful fates of its 'Ten Little Soldier Boys'. The clear winner in an international online poll held to discover the world's favourite Agatha Christie book, this new paperback also coincides with a new 3-part BBC TV adaptation featuring a stellar ensemble cast: Douglas Booth, Charles Dance, Maeve Dermody, Burn Gorman, Anna Maxwell Martin, Sam Neill, Miranda Richardson, Toby Stephens, Noah Taylor and Aidan Turner.",

Enjoy this classic work today. These selected paragraphs distill the contents and give you a quick look inside The Behavior of Crowds - A Psychological Study: Look inside the book: The most striking peculiarity presented by a psychological crowd is the following: Whoever be the individuals that compose it, however like or unlike be their mode of life, their occupations, their character or their intelligence, the fact that they have been transformed into a crowd puts them in possession of a sort of collective mind which makes them feel, think, and act in a manner quite different from that in which each individual of them would feel, think, and act were he in a state of isolation.... ...23 The phenomena which we call the crowd-mind, instead of being the outgrowth of the directly social, are social only in the sense that all mental life has social significance; they are rather the result of forces hidden in the personal and unconscious psyche of the members of the crowd, forces which are merely released by social gatherings of a certain sort.",

But today the field of personality science has moved well beyond the nature vs. nurture debate. In Who Are You, Really? Dr. Brian Little presents a distinctive view of how personality shapes our lives--and why this matters. Little makes the case for a third nature to the human condition--the pursuit of personal projects, idealistic dreams, and creative ventures that shape both people's lives and their personalities. Little uncovers what personality science has been discovering about the role of personal projects, revealing how this new concept can help people better understand themselves and shape their lives\"--Provided by publisher.",

        "description": "\"If couples therapy is to produce real transformation, authors Leslie S. Greenberg and Rhonda N. Goldman argue, the process must be hot: Emotion must be activated. Emotion fuels conflicts; therefore, therapists need to help couples get at the primary emotions that power negative interactional cycles and transform these emotions into more adaptive, functional ones. In Emotion-focused couples therapy: The dynamics of emotion, love, and power, Greenberg and Goldman explore the foundations of emotion-focused couples therapy (EFT-C) and expand its framework to focus more intently on the development of the self and relationships. The authors show how EFT-C can promote soothing and help clients deal with unmet needs from adulthood and childhood. They discuss the affect regulation involved in three major motivational systems central to couples therapy--attachment, identity, and attraction--and clarify the role of emotions and motivations in the dominance dimension of couples interactions. Written with practitioners and graduate students in mind, the chapters present a rich variety of case material to demonstrate how working with emotions can facilitate change in couples and, by extension, in all situations in which people may be in emotional conflict with others. Greenberg and Goldman provide the tools needed to identify specific emotions and show the reader how to work with them to resolve conflict and promote bonding in couples therapy\"--Jacket.

We were greatly saddened by his untimely death. This book is an attempt to remember him. We dedicate the volume to John with thanks for the contributions he made to our research, to the Faculty of Commerce and Business Administration at the University of British Columbia, and to the accounting profession. This volume contains twelve invited papers on the general topic of the economic theory of information and contracts. We asked leading scholars who had known John to contribute papers. The response was very gratifying. The authors provided us with new strong research papers that should make a lasting contribution to the accounting and information economics research literature, and make us all proud to have put this volume together. The research papers in the volume are in three sections: information evaluation in multi person conte)l:ts; contracting in agencies under moral hazard; and contracting in agencies with private information. We begin part I with Jerry Feltham's review of John Butterworth's pioneering contributions to the accounting and information economics literature. This is followed by an introduction to the papers in the volume and the papers themselves.",

        "description": "This book focuses on market mechanisms which protect quality in the provision of audit services. The role of public regulation is thus situated in the context defmed by the presence of these safeguard mechanisms. The book aims to contribute to a better understanding of these market mechanisms, which helps in defining the con tent of rules and the function of regulatory bodies in facilitating and strengthening the protective operation of the market. An analysis at a more general level is provided in the three chapters making up Part 1. In the four chapters of Part 2, on the other hand, this analysis is applied to a particular problem to determine how those non-audit services often provided by auditors to their audit clients should be regulated. Finally, Chapter 8 contains a summary of the analysis and conclusions of the work. The conclusion with regard to non-audit services is that their provision generates beneficial effects in terms of costs, technical competence, professional judgment and competition and, moreover, need not prejudice auditor independence or the quality of these services. This as sessment leads, in the normative sphere, to recommending a legislative policy aimed at facilitating the development and use of safeguards provided by the free action of market forces. Regulation should thus aim to enable the parties-audit firms, self-regulatory bodies and audit clients-to discover through competitive market interaction both the most efficient mix of services and the corresponding quality safeguards, adjusting for the costs and benefits of each possibility.",

The work offers detail about the effects of China\u2019s economic reforms on management control in Chinese enterprises and insightful comparisons with Western theory and Western examples. Readers will discover important themes and the evolution of theory in MCS, including discussions of frameworks and the links between management control and economics, management, accounting, cybernetics and system theory. Early chapters explore management control in Chinese enterprises during the period, especially the demands of (guidance, enforcement and external regulation) and the demand for (stakeholders, managers, investors) management control. The work moves on to explore Western management control theory and research, including an examination of the evolution of internal control theory. The author presents detailed perspectives on the elements of management control systems and introduces masterful new ideas and methods through four general control models and ten critical elements in the management control process. A view of management control in various different types of enterprise is presented, from special enterprises and small to medium enterprises to non-profit organizations. The standards for enterprise management control are explored. This work is a valuable practical guide for corporate management teams who wish to develop and execute their own internal control strategies. It will also provide foreign researchers, policy-makers and practitioners with a new perspective on Chinese management control experiences.",

        "description": "With the Bologna Accords a bachelor-master-doctor curriculum has been introduced in various countries with the intention that students may enter the job market already at the bachelor level. Since financial Institutions provide non negligible job opportunities also for mathematicians, and scientists in general, it appeared to be appropriate to have a financial mathematics course already at the bachelor level in mathematics. Most mathematical techniques in use in financial mathematics are related to continuous time models and require thus notions from stochastic analysis that bachelor students do in general not possess. Basic notions and methodologies in use in financial mathematics can however be transmitted to students also without the technicalities from stochastic analysis by using discrete time (multi-period) models for which general notions from Probability suffice and these are generally familiar to students not only from science courses, but also from economics with quantitative curricula. There do not exists many textbooks for multi-period models and the present volume is intended to fill in this gap. It deals with the basic topics in financial mathematics and, for each topic, there is a theoretical section and a problem section. The latter includes a great variety of possible problems with complete solution.",

        "description": "Psychology and Philosophy provides a history of the relations between philosophy and the science of psychology from late scholasticism to contemporary discussions. The book covers the development from 16th-century interpretations of Aristotle\u2019s De Anima, through Kantianism and the 19th-century revival of Aristotelianism, up to 20th-century phenomenological and analytic studies of consciousness and the mind. In this volume historically divergent conceptions of psychology as a science receive special emphasis. The volume illuminates the particular nature of studies of the psyche in the contexts of Aristotelian and Cartesian as well as 19th- and 20th-century science and philosophy. The relations between metaphysics, transcendental philosophy, and natural science are studied in the works of Kant, Brentano, Bergson, Husserl, Merleau-Ponty, Wittgenstein, and Davidson. Accounts of less known philosophers, such as Trendelenburg and Maine de Biran, throw new light on the history of the field. Discussions concerning the connections between moral philosophy and philosophical psychology broaden the volume\u2019s perspective and show new directions for development. All contributions are based on novel research in their respective fields. The collection provides materials for researchers and graduate students in the fields of philosophy of mind, history of philosophy, and psychology.",

        "description": "Human reasoning is marked by an ability to remember one's personal past and to imagine one's future. Together these capacities rely on the notion of a temporally extended self or the self in time. Recent evidence suggests that it is during the preschool period that children first construct this form of self. By about four years of age, children can remember events from their pasts and reconstruct a personal narrative integrating these events. They know that past events in which they participated affect present circumstances. They can also imagine the future and make decisions designed to bring about desirable future events even in the face of competing immediate gratification. This book brings together the leading researchers on these issues and for the first time in literature, illustrates how a unified approach based on the idea of a temporally extended self can integrate these topics.",

        "description": "If there is one topic on which we all are experts, it is ourselves. Psychologists depend upon this expertise, as asking people questions about themselves is an important means by which they gather the data that provide much of the evidence for psychological theory. Personal recollections play an important role in clinical theorizing; people's thoughts, feelings, and beliefs provide the principal data for attitudinal research; and judgments of one's traits and descriptions of one's goals and motivations are essential for the study of personality. Yet despite their long dependence on self-report data, psychologists know very little about this basic resource and the processes that govern it. In spite of the importance of the self as a concept in psychology, virtually no empirically-tested representational models of self-knowledge can be found. Recently, however, several theoretical accounts of the representation of self-knowledge have been proposed. These models have been concerned primarily with the factors underlying a particular type of self knowledge -- our trait conceptions of ourselves. The models all share the starting assumption that the source of our knowledge of the traits that describe us is memory for our past behavior. The lead article in this volume reviews the available models of the processes underlying trait self-descriptiveness judgments. Although these models appear quite different in their basic representational assumptions, exemplar and abstraction models sometimes are difficult to distinguish experimentally. Presenting a series of studies using several new techniques which the authors believe are effective for assessing whether people recruit specific exemplars or abstract trait summaries when making trait judgments about themselves, they conclude that specific behavioral exemplars play a far smaller role in the representation of trait knowledge than previously has been assumed. Finally, the limitations of social cognition paradigms as methods for studying the representation of long-term social knowledge are discussed, and the implications of the research for both existing and future social psychological research are explored.",

Analysing empirical evidence and theoretical frameworks, the author evaluates the role of leaders in the failure of African globalisation and seeks to propose an initiative for change. As emphasis shifts from world control to regional and sub-regional control, the new face of globalisation offers an opportunity for Africa to grow and develop with a new leadership perspective. Presenting servant leadership as a solution to Africa\u2019s global failures, this timely book explores the challenges of governance, resource management and regionalisation, and will be of value to anyone interested in the development of Africa as a continent.",

In doing so, it offers both conceptual perspectives and case studies on these topics that are targeted at business executives who want to develop and mature towards being successful value creators in their leadership roles. Authored by the former CEO of National Australia Bank (NAB), Don Argus, and business school professor Danny Samson, the book provides insights on the strategic leadership factors that make a significant and positive difference when they are executed effectively and, in contrast, what happens when ineffective leadership/ strategy are deployed. It proposes and illustrates core leadership axioms, and also delves into sustainable development as an element of strategy. The authors do this by developing and illustrating core concepts that relate to the two major case study companies of NAB and BHP. Readers will be particularly interested in the core elements of leadership and strategy, and the grounded reality of how they operated in the case studies. The authors bring insiders\u2019 and leaders\u2019 perspectives to these topics, including tables that document shareholder value creation, and the logic behind strategic decisions, as well as key organisational leadership and strategic decision processes.",

        "description": "The ping-pong diplomacy and its aftermath discussion, coupled with the entry of communist China into the United Nations and the subsequent expulsion of Taiwan, will generate considerable political dialogue about the changing balance of power and the fate of the other China. These political discussions will obviously overshadow the true role and function of the existence of Taiwan. Given the time, Taiwan could become a model for the development process for other emerging countries. Taiwan's experience with eco nomic development has real relevance for many countries. For exam ple, in less than two decades Taiwan has achieved the industrial and economic growth that should well make it the envy of nearly all other developing nations. Its per capita income is exceeded only by Japan among the countries of the Far East. Yet, despite vigorous economic and industrial growth, obvious breakdowns in this economic progress come into view. The lack of managerial input threatens to become a real bottleneck. The study reported in this volume examines the feasibility and utility of transferring advanced management know-how and practices into the industrial enterprises in Taiwan in order to generate further economic and industrial growth. The study itself concerns management practices and effectiveness of American subsidiaries, Japanese sub sidiaries, and comparable local firms in Taiwan.",

This hard-hitting book proves it with indisputable facts drawn from scientific research and the author's own thirty-five years of experience in the investment industry. Michael Edesess exposes \u201cThe Big Investment Lie\u201d: that an investor will gain by hiring professional advisors to beat the market. He proves that no professional investment advisor or manager has ever consistently and predictably beat market averages, not even Warren Buffett. While The Big Investment Lie allows an entire industry to prosper lavishly, investors invariably lose when they hire professional help. Once you know the truth, you'll want to adopt Edesess's Ten New Commandments for Smart Investing, simple rules you can follow to invest, get a profitable return, and avoid squandering any more of your hard-earned dollars on bogus expertise.",

Who you truly are as opposed to whom you are told you are. This is all based on a very introspective view of our individual self-esteem and attitude toward our expectations of life. As well as our personal contributions to the community in which we live and serve. *Belief in Yourself *The Real You *Knowing What You Want (and how to obtain it) The intermediate chapters seek to expose and destroy the power of the common negative opposition in our lives. These being the daily events, and personalities that we allow to prevent our personal growth and development. *Negative Circumstances *Doubt *Self Denial *Distractions *Negative People The ensuing and final chapters deal with the solutions to resolve, fulfill and ultimately achieve our personal best in life. This being accomplished through the arming of ourselves with more meaningful values, positive attitude, proper guidance and a firm foundation rooted with good moral virtue. *Who and What controls The Power *Research *Tenacity and Persistence *Rest and Proper Dieting *Follow Through The early part of this book takes on a sort of personal challenge to the reader in a somewhat humorous form. Then it goes on into a more formal arena of revelation. Considering there is an abundance of self-help / personal improvement types of literature on the market, I sought to be very unique in \"my\" approach.",

        "description": "Shame is a difficult emotion, and most of us do what we can to avoid it. But veteran psychologist Joe Burgo shows us how we can use shame - which is an inevitable part of being human - as a tool for better understanding ourselves and our relationships with others. Encounters with embarrassment, guilt, self-consciousness and remorse are an unavoidable part of everyday life, and they sometimes have lessons to teach us - about our goals and values, about the person we expect ourselves to be. Richly illustrated with clinical stories from Burgo's 35 years in private practice, Shame suggests that this often excruciating emotion tells us a lot about our own self-awareness, and should not always be considered a toxic influence in our lives. Joseph Burgo takes an intimate look at the full spectrum of shame - often masked by addiction, promiscuity, perfectionism, self-loathing, or narcissism - and offers a new, positive route forward on the road to authentic self-esteem. 'An essential read for anyone who suffers from shame and self-criticism. This book can help transform the way you see yourself and the world.'

He's not after some superficial outward tinkering, but instead a deep rooted, life altering change that takes place on the inside. In an age where pleasing people, puffing up your ego and building your resume are seen as the methods to make it, the Apostle Paul calls us to find true rest in blessed self forgetfulness. In this short and punchy book, best selling author Timothy Keller, shows that gospel humility means we can stop connecting every experience, every conversation with ourselves and can thus be free from self condemnation. A truly gospel humble person is not a self hating person or a self loving person, but a self forgetful person. This freedom can be yours...",

        "description": "Drawing upon the perspective of social identity theory, The Development of the Social Self is concerned with the acquisition and development of children's social identities. In contrast to previous work on self-development, which has focused primarily on the development of the personal self, this volume makes a case for the importance of the study of the social self - that is, the self as defined through group memberships, such as gender, ethnicity, and nationality. A broad range of identity-related issues are addressed, such as ingroup identification, conceptions of social identities, prejudice, and the central role of social context. Based on contributions from leading researchers in Europe, Australia and the US, the book summarises the major research programmes conducted to date. Furthermore, the closing chapters provide commentary on this research, as well as mapping out key directions for future research. With a unique focus encompassing both social and developmental psychology, The Development of the Social Self will appeal to a broad spectrum of students and researchers in both disciplines, as well as those working in related areas such as sociology and child development.",

Management in all business and organizational activities is the act of getting people together to accomplish desired goals and objectives using available resources efficiently and effectively. Management comprises planning, organizing, staffing, leading or directing, and controlling an organization (a group of one or more people or entities) or effort for the purpose of accomplishing a goal. Resourcing encompasses the deployment and manipulation of human resources, financial resources, technological resources and natural resources. The proceedings of BEFM2011 focuses on the various aspects of advances in Business, Economics, and Financial Sciences, Management and provides a chance for academic and industry professionals to discuss recent progress in the area of Business, Economics, and Financial Sciences, Management.

        "description": "Ever since the first Olympic Games in Ancient Greece, sports have become an integral part of human civilization. The last decade has been commemorated by the centennial celebration of the modern Olympic movement. With great anticipation, the Olympics return to Athens, Greece, and we are once again reminded that we live in one of the most exciting periods in the history of sports. Reflecting back on my years of service as the International Olympic Com mittee president, I cannot overlook the remarkable changes that have taken place in the world of sports during these two decades. The technological de velopment and consequent globalization of the world economy opened up a window of new opportunities for the sports industry. As a result, manage ment, economics, and other sciences have become a significant part of modern sports. It is my pleasure to introduce this volume comprising an interesting collec tion of papers dealing with various aspects of management, economics and optimization applied to sports. May this book serve as a valuable source of information to researchers and practitioners as well as to casual readers look ing for a deeper insight into the magnificent world of sports.",

It applies key concepts in economics and business to a wide variety of situations helping you to answer questions such as: Why is offshoring now a major concern for South Korea?

This is the ideal textbook for students following courses in introductory economics with a business and management focus. Its detailed consideration of wider dimensions of the business environment, such as political, legal, ethical, sociocultural, technological and environmental issues, make it more suitable for more general courses on the business environment with an economic underpinning.\"--Cover.",

        "description": "'This meticulous book submits research and the research process to deep scrutiny. It debunks the unhelpful dichotomy between quantitative and qualitative research and highlights the great value of multi-method and interactive research, approaches that have greatly deepened our thinking.' \u2013 Professor Adrian Payne, University of New South Wales, Australia / Professor Pennie Frow, University of Sydney Setting out to dispel the argument that case study research lacks the science, theory and therefore validity of other forms of research, Evert Gummesson combines many decades of experience as both a renowned scholar and a reflective practitioner to effectively bridge the divide between case theory and how it is applied in practice. Bringing the fundamental strengths of cases to the fore, Gummesson introduces the 'Case Theory' concept as an expanded version of case study research which includes both methodology and the types of results that emerge by: Guiding the reader in the theoretical and philosophical underpinning Demonstrating how to translate theory to pertinent research practice that address the real and consequential issues in business and management today. This book will appeal to students, academics and researchers who are interested in the science and philosophy behind case study research as well as the methodology and a thought-provoking read for anyone who wants to be challenged about their belief of case study theory.",

        "description": "It is appropriate that the second edition of this established textbook sold in over 150 countries and regarded by many as the standard work on the subject -should be published at a time of great change in the international shipping industry. This edition reflects such change. It also places considerable emphasis on the need for a professional approach in all areas of shipping practice and management in order to provide the high quality service required to sustain and expand international trade, and will help to establish that professionalism. The book is ideal not only for students preparing for shipping examinations but also for persons employed in shipping companies, ashore and afloat. In short it is an aide-memo ire to those engaged in the industry throughout the world and is regarded by many as the shipping executive's handbook. Readers who wish to know more about the basic elements of the subject should also study the com panion volume Elements of Shipping (fifth edition). In addition, the sea port operator or executive should study my recently published book Elements of Port Operation and Management. The opportunity has been taken to widen the scope of the book. New chapters have been included on the economics of container ization, computerization, roll on/roll off (Ro/Ro) vessels and their features, and counter-trade. In addition, a number of existing chapters have been expanded in the areas of marketing, budgets, political factors, ship finance, BIFFEX, ICHCA, IMO, GCBS, and shipping company mergers and acquisitions.",

        "description": "In many countries of the world there is a growing feeling of uneasiness about the economic situation and its related social consequences. Every day the newspapers tell us that the recession is over, but we see only that scores of organizations go bankrupt, while others are struggling hard to stay in business; that many people have lost their jobs, but welfare measures are being reduced or abolished altogether. By now we should have become aware that our society is not facing temporary market difficulties, but a much deeper and wider crisis with only one root in worldwide economic developments, while other roots are social and psychological in nature. These factors are intertwined, and therefore the answer to the crisis cannot merely be an economic cost-benefit analysis of organizational management. Sociocultural factors participate in the economic process even at the level of individual organizations, and what happens in them has backlash influences on the entire society. Therefore the problem is not the management of the individual organization, but the macroconception of management, which in the Western world of today separates the economic aspects from the social ones, and the individual organizations from society. Social and Economic Management in the Competitive Society begins by analyzing the management models of today to determine which characteristics yield the best results on the economic and social levels. The second step is to indicate the necessary changes of managerial thinking and acting, in order to boost economic results with reasonable profits while minimizing social costs. Finally, the potential ramifications of such changes are explored.",

An ideal professional reference or student text, the book examines how social psychological knowledge can serve as the basis for theory-driven evaluation; facilitate more effective partnerships with stakeholders and policy makers; and help evaluators ask more effective questions about behavior. Also identified are ways in which real-world evaluation findings can identify gaps in social psychological theory and test and improve the validity of social psychological findings; for example, in the areas of cooperation, competition, and intergroup relations. The volume includes a useful glossary of both fields' terms and offers practical suggestions for fostering cross-fertilization in research, graduate training, and employment opportunities. Each tightly edited chapter features an introduction and concluding reflection/discussion questions from the editors.",

        "description": "Governments in the developing nations of Africa invest much of their peoples scarce resources in social development programs, often without much evaluation or any knowledge of the potential outcomes. Written by a social psychology consultant, Denis Ugwuegbu, Social Psychology and Social Development in Nigeria puts forth a calm, expert, and systematic evaluation of some government policies under military dictators in Nigeria. The programs and policies studied range from government efforts to create a homogenous multicultural cohesive national unity in Nigeria to the nations perception of the Nigeria police and military coups. Social Psychology can empower a developing nation to participate in social policy democracy. Important insights, conclusions, and recommendations for action are offered along with advocacy for social development program and policy evaluation for practitioners and social scientists interested in research about national development. Social Psychology and Social Change in Nigeria is the first book of its kind to be written in Africa, for Africa and other developing nations with clarity and enough detail to make it accessible to an audience beyond professional social scientists.",

        "description": "Inspired by recent advances in the area of social psychology, researchers are rapidly developing realistic and detailed models of the psychological process that determines political judgements and behavior. Early attempts to merely predict political behavior have been replaced by an attempt to describe the actual process whereby individuals gather, interpret, exchange, and combine information to arrive at a political judgment or decision. This volume provides comprehensive coverage of this pioneering era of research in political psychology.",

        "description": "This handbook provides a broad overview of the field of social psychology and up-to-date coverage of current social psychological topics. It reflects the recent and substantial development of the field, both with regard to theory and empirical research. It starts out by covering major theoretical perspectives, including the inter actionist, identity, social exchange, social structure and the person perspectives. Next, it discusses development and socialization in childhood, adolescence and adulthood. In addition to updated discussions of topics that were included in the first edition, the part examining personal processes includes entirely new topics, such as social psychology and the body and individual agency and social motivation. Interpersonal processes are discussed from a contemporary perspective with a focus on stress and health. The final section examines the person in sociocultural context and includes another topic new to the second edition, the social psychology of race and gender and intersectionality.",

With vengeance they betrayed us. When she's kidnapped by the Blessed Engineers, Arla discovers that she's been living a lie. She wasn't a farmer's daughter, but merely cargo transported in the carved out heart of an asteroid: the Arkship Dawn on a thousand year voyage to a new home. And someone got there first. One act of rebellion leads to the fate of her people resting on her young shoulders. And, perhaps the future of humanity itself. Because Dawn harbors a secret. It is the key. Destiny awaits. Dawn Exodus is the first book in a now complete six book series of space opera in the classic vein of Asimov, Bradbury and Bear. If you like clean, fast paced, intelligent sci-fi that's full of ideas, memorable characters and examines what it truly is to be human, then the Robot Empire series is for you. \"Reminiscent of some of my favorite old time SciFi authors\" - Mark \"Inspired world building\" - Belle \"A brilliant read with an epic and unexpected ending\" - Bethany For readers who enjoy: Isaac Asimov's Foundation Star Wars Star Trek Battlestar Galactica The Orville The Expanse",

I thought I would spend the rest of my life with him. But then a terminal illness took him and broke my heart. I spent the years after his death pouring my heart and all my strength into my work, which made me a multi-awarded US Space Police Officer by the year 2045. That was also the year that I tried to open up my heart again to someone. I thought my police partner and boyfriend Kent and I would build something great together. But when we were sent to Planet Zil for a special mission, destiny came into play. We were torn apart and I found myself abducted by one of the enemies \u2013 a genetically engineered human soldier who happened to be my late husband. As we spent time together, all my feelings resurfaced once again. Here I was with the man I had exchanged \"I Do\"s with, yearning to have another chance to start anew yet uncertain if he was still the same man deep inside underneath the monster he'd been made to be. Should I escape as soon as I had the chance, and finish off my mission with Kent?

The Indigo Reports series: 0.5 Flying Blind 1.0 New Star Rising 1.1 But Now I See 2.0 Suns Eclipsed 3.0 Worlds Beyond Space Opera Science Fiction Novel __ Praise for The Indigo Reports series: The story is unpredictable, the horror and pain is real. This is an epic saga!! The signature intensity and tension of the Indigo series is back!!! This is epic science fiction at its finest. Realistic far future worlds. Incredible characters and scenarios. Cameron knows how to tell a story, regardless of whether we are going back in history or forward in time. Until this book I had forgotten just how much I love good science fiction and Cameron\u2019s is not just good, it\u2019s exceptional. This is a complex tale of planetary politics, plotting, spying, scientific marvels, and advanced androids. Plus there is the fascinating floating city of Demos. The concepts are staggering and intensely interesting. The Indigo Reports series is far more than I ever anticipated. This story is terrific! It's intriguing and futuristic and human in its telling. One of my favorite and most satisfying science fiction series to read. A series to devour. __ Cameron Cooper is the author of the Imperial Hammer series, an Amazon best-selling space opera series, among others.

When timelines cross, the world as we know it bends . . . Skid Roe is completely self-absorbed and delusional. His struggle to exercise free will is constantly hampered by the physical manifestation of his inner demons and by the norms and rules of contemporary life. He's both aided and hindered by Lem, a robot from the future whose good intentions leave Skid on the run from a shadowy state security agency. A surreal, beautiful, and powerful literary mash-up, Basili\u00e8\u008fres' long-awaited sophomore effort is inventive and darkly funny.",

A new civilization has risen from the ashes of the late 21st century End of Times, and it has thrived in the few remaining inhabitable highland areas of the planet, thanks mainly to the all-powerful State governance engineering a series of stunning advances in Artificial Intelligence. Something, however, is going horribly wrong on Planet 42. People are disappearing at an alarming rate, and the State is beset by a series of crippling scandals all the while most of its people slave away in something close to abject poverty. So much for the supposed socialist utopia. Andrew Weems is a scrawny young journalism student in The Highlands of Alba, once known as Scotland. He has a quirky, some would say annoying sense of humor and swears quite a lot. His best friend is John McGregor, an elite Alban college student, and his other friend is John\u2019s girlfriend, Claire Renshaw, a talented cybercrimes student. In trying to find information on the death of her older sister, Claire hacks into some highly classified State data relating to something known as the Elyssium program, and the discovery sets in motion a chain of events that will lead them all on an epic journey encompassing kidnap, murder, assassination attempts, fishing, strange mushrooms, and the resultant sea monster, and other things. Ultimately, the shocking truth about the disappearances is exposed and this leads Claire to a confrontation with horrors, and evil beyond imagination. Except that it has been imagined, so \u2026 with horrors and evil beyond comprehension, instead.",

        "description": "We is a dystopian novel which is set in a dystopian future police state. D-503 lives in the One State, an urban nation constructed almost entirely of glass, which allows the secret police/spies to inform on and supervise the public more easily. The structure of the state is analogous to the prison design concept developed by Jeremy Bentham commonly referred to as the Panopticon. Furthermore, life is organized to promote maximum productive efficiency along the lines of the system advocated by the hugely influential F. W. Taylor. People march in step with each other and wear identical clothing. There is no way of referring to people save by their given numbers. Males have odd numbers prefixed by consonants; females have even numbers prefixed by vowels. Along with Jack London's The Iron Heel, We is generally considered to be the grandfather of the satirical futuristic dystopia genre. Yevgeny Zamyatin (1884-1937) was a Russian author of science fiction and political satire. Due to his use of literature to criticize Soviet society, Zamyatin has been referred to as one of the first Soviet dissidents.",

Each vaccinated citizen is identified by a tiny microchip \u2014 the most intelligent piece of technology ever to be implanted in a human being that tracks and analyzes your every move. Twenty-year-old Haven Allis is in the system: her Citizen ID tracks her location, conversations, Internet activity, bank account \u2014 everything. Any suspicious activity is warrant for arrest. But for those who are undocumented, life is much worse. Illegals are taken to the prisons in Sector X and made to disappear. When her best friend Greyson is captured and arrested for his undocumented status, Haven must go off the grid to save him. Life outside the city has its own dangers: carriers of the virus lurk everywhere, and the Private Military Company is rounding up illegals. On her mission to rescue Greyson, Haven will discover a revolution in motion and be forced to question everything she believes. *** KEYWORDS: Dystopian, post-apocalyptic, strong heroine, free, free book, free read, futuristic story free, science fiction free, futuristic dystopian story free, freebie, science fiction, action and adventure, dystopian future, dystopian free, survival, survival story, survival fiction, dystopian romance, dystopian romance free, post-apocalyptic free, post-apocalyptic book, dystopian book, strong female lead, female protagonist, books that are free, sci fi books that are free, read ebooks for free, stories to read online free, google books free to read, zombies, zombie apocalypse, zombie books free, virus, YA dystopian, YA dystopian books, YA dystopian free, YA dystopian books free, evil government, government shutdown, epidemic, zombie virus, revolution, young adult dystopian series",

Here the individual is discouraged, freedom is an illusion, food is rationed, and everything you do is tracked by a chip implanted in your arm. This is Dana Ginary\u2019s world. At age seventeen, people receive their career assignments chosen for them by a government body. Forced to work at the Waste Management Plant because she was declared too individualistic, Dana finds herself surrounded by death and brutality. Knowing her days are numbered, she looks for a way to leave the plant before she, too, becomes one of its causalities. It is then she meets a man named George and soon finds herself caught up in a cat and mouse game between the resistance and the Dystopian government. Dana finds herself faced with an agonizing choice of whom she will betray and whom she will save: her friend George, her parents, or herself. The eyes are always watching.",

        "description": "Drawing comparisons to the most eloquent science writing of our day, three eminent psychiatrists tackle the difficult task of reconciling what artists and thinkers have known for thousands of years about the human heart with what has only recently been learned about the primitive functions of the human brain. The result is an original, lucid, at times moving account of the complexities of love and its essential role in human well-being. A General Theory of Love draws on the latest scientific research to demonstrate that our nervous systems are not self-contained: from earliest childhood, our brains actually link with those of the people close to us, in a silent rhythm that alters the very structure of our brains, establishes life-long emotional patterns, and makes us, in large part, who we are. Explaining how relationships function, how parents shape their child\u2019s developing self, how psychotherapy really works, and how our society dangerously flouts essential emotional laws, this is a work of rare passion and eloquence that will forever change the way you think about human intimacy.

When the Surgeon General's report was finally released in 1972\u2014after a three-year inquiry and a cost of over $1.8 million\u2014it angered and confused a number of critics, including politicians, the broadcast industry, many of the social scientists who had helped carry out the research, and the public. While the final consequences of the Report may not be played out for years to come, TV Violence and the Child presents a fascinating study of the Surgeon General's quest and, in effect, the process by which social science is recruited and its findings made relevant to public policy. In addition to dealing with television as an object of concern, the authors also consider the government's effectiveness when dealing with social objectives and the influence of citizen action on our communication systems. Their overwhelming conclusion is that the nation's institutions are ill-equipped for recruiting expert talent, providing clear findings, and carrying out objectives in this area of delicate human concern.",

Each chapter focuses on one theoretical problem, proposes a novel solution, and is written in sufficiently non-technical language to be understandable by advanced undergraduates or scientists in allied fields. This book is the very first collection in the field of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) focusing on theoretical, conceptual, and philosophical issues in the creation of thinking machines. All the authors are researchers actively developing AGI projects, thus distinguishing the book from much of the theoretical cognitive science and AI literature, which is generally quite divorced from practical AGI system building issues. And the discussions are presented in a way that makes the problems and proposed solutions understandable to a wide readership of non-specialists, providing a distinction from the journal and conference-proceedings literature. The book will benefit AGI researchers and students by giving them a solid orientation in the conceptual foundations of the field (which is not currently available anywhere); and it would benefit researchers in allied fields by giving them a high-level view of the current state of thinking in the AGI field. Furthermore, by addressing key topics in the field in a coherent way, the collection as a whole may play an important role in guiding future research in both theoretical and practical AGI, and in linking AGI research with work in allied disciplines",

        "description": "Without a clear and organized view of where and how entrepreneurship manifests itself, policy makers have been left in uncharted waters without an analytical compass. The purpose of this book is to provide such an analytical compass for directing how public policy can shape and promote entrepreneurship. We do this in two ways. The first is to provide a framework for policymakers and scholars to understand what determines entrepreneurship. The second is to apply this framework to a series of cases, or country studies. In particular, this book seeks to answer three questions about entrepreneurship: What has happened over time? Why did it happen? And, what has been the role of government policy? The cornerstone of the book is the proposed Eclectic Theory of Entrepreneurship. The goal of the Eclectic Theory is to provide a unified framework for understanding and analyzing the determinants of entrepreneurship. The Eclectic Theory of entrepreneurship integrates the different strands from relevant fields into a unifying, coherent framework. At the heart of the Eclectic Theory is the integration of factors shaping the demand for entrepreneurship on the one hand, with those influencing the supply of entrepreneurs on the other hand. The key to understanding the role of public policy is through identifying those channels shifting either the demand for or the supply of entrepreneurship by policy instruments. The findings in this book show that, by utilizing the framework provided by the Eclectic Theory of Entrepreneurship, it is within the grasp of policymakers to identify the determinants of entrepreneurship in a particular country setting at a particular point in time. This will be essential in formulating new public policies to promote entrepreneurship and, ultimately, economic growth, job creation and international competitiveness.",

        "description": "The importance of entrepreneurship for achieving economic growth in contemporary economies is widely recognized, both by policy makers and economists. It is deeply embedded in the current European policy approach that the creativity and independence of entrepreneurs contribute to higher levels of economic activity. Indeed, according to the European Commission (2003, p. 9), \"The challenge for the European Union is to identify the key factors for building a climate in which entrepreneurial initiative and business activities can thrive. Policy measures should seek to boost the Union's levels of entrepreneurship, adopting the most appropriate approach for producing more entrepreneurs and for getting more firms to grow. \" Audretsch (2003, p. 5) states that \"Entrepreneurship has become the engine of economic and social development throughout the world. \" The relation between entrepreneurship and economic growth is embedded in several strands of the economic literature. A first strand of literature involves the general understanding of the role of entrepreneurship in the modern economy. Seminal contributions were made by Schumpeter (1934), Knight (1921) and Kirzner (1973). These economists stress different aspects of the role of the entrepreneur. While Schumpeter stresses the innovating aspect, Knight stresses the risk assuming aspect. Kirzner, finally, stresses the role of the entrepreneur in leading markets to equilibrium. Acs (1992) discusses the contribution of small firms in modern economies.",

        "description": "A new king promises peace, but old hatreds return After defeating the insurrection, Ludwig returns home to his family, only to be ordered back to the capital. Thrust into the responsibility of being the realm's new prince, he struggles to balance his loyalty to his sovereign with his own idea of justice. King Morgan seeks to strengthen his new rule, but the barons of Hadenfeld are a wary lot, each determined to dominate the other. Overwhelmed by the conflict at court, he is wracked by indecision, leaving him at the mercy of outside influences. When a new voice finds the ear of the king, Ludwig falls into disfavour. Banished to the east to bring the rebel barons to heel for their disloyalty, he makes a discovery that shakes the very foundations of the Petty Kingdoms. But only after receiving a letter from an old friend does he realizes the enemy is much closer than he ever suspected. Can he save his newly reunited kingdom, or will they fall once more into the chaos of war? The story of an emerging leader continues in Paul J Bennett\u2019s Warrior Prince, Book Six of the Power Ascending Series.

        "description": "A pseudo-sorceress and a real danger. Selunia has questionable magical skills and a forbidden wish: to protect Prince Soris of the Arid Kingdom. So she puts on a soldier's armor and quietly infiltrates the castle... ...only to discover the castle is under siege and a deadly spell was cast upon the prince! Fall in love in a Neo-medieval world, feel the thrills of an epic fantasy battle, and chuckle as you follow Selunia's clumsy attempts at bravery and Soris' innocent misunderstandings. Genres: YA Fantasy Romance, Action/Adventure Editorial review \"A Captivating and Powerful Story That Will Put You On the Edge of Your Seat and Leave You Wanting More. Selunia is a young girl with special powers, at least through the help of her crystal gloves. She is sent from her home at the White Castle to the nearby Arid Kingdom. Once there, she quickly finds herself the sole protector of the kingdom. But will she be able to triumph over the powerful and numerous enemy that threatens them all? Tina does a remarkable job at using multiple points of view without confusing the reader or losing the focus of the story. Her writing style is easy to follow and flows well. There is no heavy use of profanity and no intense romantic scenes which makes this a great book for all ages. The characters of the story are well-developed, and the action and suspense made for a quick, fun read. The story kept me intrigued from beginning to end. Silvens shows much promise as an author. I hope to see more from her in the future and am anxious to see how she will further develop this story in the series.\" Elizaveta Katrinova Tina Silvens is an author dedicated to the fantasy genre. Although she has been writing since school days, her first book was published in 2017. \"The Mysterious Soldier \u2013 Part I\" is the first book in the Arid Kingdom series, a story she kept working on for more than 10 years before finally reaching out into the world of published books.",

        "description": "The Analytic Network Process (ANP), developed by Thomas Saaty in his work on multicriteria decision making, applies network structures with dependence and feedback to complex decision making. This new edition of Decision Making with the Analytic Network Process is a selection of the latest applications of ANP to economic, social and political decisions, and also to technological design. The ANP is a methodological tool that is helpful to organize knowledge and thinking, elicit judgments registered in both in memory and in feelings, quantify the judgments and derive priorities from them, and finally synthesize these diverse priorities into a single mathematically and logically justifiable overall outcome. In the process of deriving this outcome, the ANP also allows for the representation and synthesis of diverse opinions in the midst of discussion and debate. The book focuses on the application of the ANP in three different areas: economics, the social sciences and the linking of measurement with human values. Economists can use the ANP for an alternate approach for dealing with economic problems than the usual mathematical models on which economics bases its quantitative thinking. For psychologists, sociologists and political scientists, the ANP offers the methodology they have sought for some time to quantify and derive measurements for intangibles. Finally the book applies the ANP to provide people in the physical and engineering sciences with a quantitative method to link hard measurement to human values. In such a process, one is able to interpret the true meaning of measurements made on a uniform scale using a unit.",

The successful use of case studies in business schools shows the superior outcomes of an interdisciplinary approach to problem solving. Disappointingly, functional departmental silos within universities still exist and keep problem solvers from seeing all the effects of a given issue. In addition to providing teaching material, Decision Making in Marketing and Finance provides motives and strategies to break down functional silos in making informed and effective business and finance decisions. Koku achieves his goal by showing how value can be created for shareholders and other stakeholders, linking marketing and finance decision making, and providing much-needed teaching materials for an interdisciplinary approach to case analysis.",

        "description": "Computing has become essential for the modeling, analysis, and optimization of systems. This book is devoted to algorithms, computational analysis, and decision models. The chapters are organized in two parts: optimization models of decisions and models of pricing and equilibria. Optimization is at the core of rational decision making. Even when the decision maker has more than one goal or there is significant uncertainty in the system, optimization provides a rational framework for efficient decisions. The Markowitz mean-variance formulation is a classical example. The first part of the book is on recent developments in optimization decision models for finance and economics. The first four chapters of this part focus directly on multi-stage problems in finance. Chapters 5-8 involve the use of worst-case robust analysis. Chapters 9-11 are devoted to portfolio optimization. The final four chapters are on transportation-inventory with stochastic demand; optimal investment with CRRA utility; hedging financial contracts; and, automatic differentiation for computational finance. The uncertainty associated with prediction and modeling constantly requires the development of improved methods and models. Similarly, as systems strive towards equilibria, the characterization and computation of equilibria assists analysis and prediction. The second part of the book is devoted to recent research in computational tools and models of equilibria, prediction, and pricing. The first three chapters of this part consider hedging issues in finance. Chapters 19-22 consider prediction and modeling methodologies. Chapters 23-26 focus on auctions and equilibria. Volatility models are investigated in chapters 27-28. The final two chapters investigate risk assessment and product pricing. Audience: Researchers working in computational issues related to economics, finance, and management science.",

During the course of their separate investigations, the teams must unite again to investigate two distinct murders -- atrocities that are oddly aligned as they share much of the same collective evidence.

        "description": "Few films have been so keenly awaited or the subject of so much internet debate as the twelfth Star Trek movie -- the first since 2002 -- which is scheduled to be released in May 2009. Directed by J.J. Abrams, creator of cutting-edge cult television shows Lostand Alias, the film is expected to launch the Star Trekfranchise into a new stellar era. Going back to the very beginnings of the classic Star Trek, the film tells how James T. Kirk, the half-Vulcan Spock, Dr McCoy, engineer Montgomery Scott and crew members Chekov, Sulu and Uhura first came together as rookie Starfleet recruits, and how they embraced the destiny that would later send them out across the galaxy accompanied by the immortal words: 'These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise\u2026' A largely brand new cast including Chris Pine as Kirk, Zachary Quinto (Heroes) as Spock, Simon Pegg as Scotty, Karl Urban as McCoy alongside Eric Bana, Winona Ryder and Leonard Nimoy will bring Star Trekto a whole new audience, while at the same time Alan Dean Foster's novelization will enthrall both existing fans and a new generation of readers.",

R. Martin has created a work of unsurpassed vision, power, and imagination. A Clash of Kings transports us to a world of revelry and revenge, wizardry and warfare unlike any we have ever experienced. A comet the color of blood and flame cuts across the sky. And from the ancient citadel of Dragonstone to the forbidding shores of Winterfell, chaos reigns. Six factions struggle for control of a divided land and the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms, preparing to stake their claims through tempest, turmoil, and war. It is a tale in which brother plots against brother and the dead rise to walk in the night. Here a princess masquerades as an orphan boy; a knight of the mind prepares a poison for a treacherous sorceress; and wild men descend from the Mountains of the Moon to ravage the countryside. Against a backdrop of incest and fratricide, alchemy and murder, victory may go to the men and women possessed of the coldest steel . . . and the coldest hearts. For when kings clash, the whole land trembles.",

        "description": "A unique, ground-breaking collection of lively, informative, and provocative essays & interviews from some of the most acclaimed and bestselling authors of tie-in books & novelizations about what they do and how they do it.Tie-in novels are books based on pre-existing media properties -- like TV shows, movies and games -- and they regularly top the national bestseller lists. But as popular as tie-ins books and novelizations are among readers, few people know how the books are written or the rich history behind the hugely successful and enduring genre. Contributors include Donald Bain, Max Allan Collins, Tod Goldberg, Elizabeth Massie, William C. Dietz, Aaron Rosenberg, Paul Kupperberg, Jeff Mariotte, Raymond Benson, Robert Greenberger, David Spencer, Greg Cox, Burl Barer, Jeff Ayers, Nancy Holder, Brandie Tarvin, Alina Adams and William Rabkin.EDITORIAL REVIEWS: \"There have always been formidable writers doing tie-ins, but they have generally been dismissed, not unreasonably, as quickies tossed off for a fast buck. That image has been improved somewhat by the quality work of editor Goldberg, the late Stuart Kaminsky, Max Allan Collins, and some of the International Association of Media Tie-in Writers members contributing to this volume. With it's helpful how-to tips and articles, the book is primarily directed towards other writers, and established pros at that. But many fans and scholars will enjoy the inside-the-business stuff.\" Jon Breen, Mystery Scene Magazine \"Tied-In doesn't focus solely on television tie-ins. It also covers movie novelizations, comic book tie-ins and computer game tie ins. But that actually makes it even more valuable and more interesting. Tied-In is a fascinating exploration of the media tie-in business.\" -- Television Obscurities Blog\"This is really interesting and entertaining stuff. I was genuinely surprised at how much fun I had reading this book, and I'm sure most of you would like it, too\" -- Bill Crider's Pop Culture Magazine \"I say this without a whit of exaggeration Tied-In is the most fascinating, entertaining and honest book about the writing life I've ever read...\" --Ed Gorman, founder of Mystery Scene Magazine",

Melinda came to understand that the spirits are trapped, and in need. She listens, tries to understand what keeps them from crossing over, and helps them find what they need to be free. It's not easy, but with time and patience her gift allows her to come to bring those spirits to peace. The sound of a mournful lullaby has been haunting Melinda in her sleep, the song of a ghost who doesn't seem ready or willing to accept her help. Knowing that earthbound spirits are often confused and troubled, Melinda feels that with time she will make a connection. But there is no time; the melodic tapestry that the ghostly singer is weaving with her words -- meant to comfort a child -- has become a trap, lulling the young listeners into such a deep sleep that no one can ever awaken them. It takes one child, then another and another, until all across the town children are drawn in by the gentle song, their lives slowly slipping away. Even Melinda, with her knowledge of the spirit world, finds herself being pulled into the beautiful snare, where she nearly loses herself. Only then does Melinda begin to worry that this is a spirit so troubled, so heartsick, that it may be beyond her help.",

The story of three women who say no: Norah, a French-born lawyer who finds herself in Senegal, summoned by her estranged father to save another victim of his paternity; Fanta, who leaves a contented life as a teacher in Dakar to follow her boyfriend back to France, where his depression and dislocation poison everything; and Khady, a penniless widow put out by her husband's family with nothing but the name of a distant cousin in France. As these three lives intertwine, each woman manages an astonishing feat of self-preservation against those who have made themselves the fastest-growing and most-reviled people in Europe. In Marie NDiaye's stunning narration we see the progress by which ordinary women discover unimagined reserves of strength.",

        "description": "WINNER OF THE NOBEL PRIZE\u00ae IN LITERATURE 2013 The only novel from Alice Munro-award-winning author of The Love of a Good Woman--is an insightful, honest book, \"autobiographical in form but not in fact,\" that chronicles a young girl's growing up in rural Ontario in the 1940's. Del Jordan lives out at the end of the Flats Road on her father's fox farm, where her most frequent companions are an eccentric bachelor family friend and her rough younger brother. When she begins spending more time in town, she is surrounded by women-her mother, an agnostic, opinionted woman who sells encyclopedias to local farmers; her mother's boarder, the lusty Fern Dogherty; and her best friend, Naomi, with whom she shares the frustrations and unbridled glee of adolescence. Through these unwitting mentors and in her own encounters with sex, birth, and death, Del explores the dark and bright sides of womanhood. All along she remains a wise, witty observer and recorder of truths in small-town life. The result is a powerful, moving, and humorous demonstration of Alice Munro's unparalleled awareness of the lives of girls and women.",

In this quietly powerful tribute, Ernaux attempts to do her mother the greatest justice she can: to portray her as the individual she was.

In July 1913, twenty-five-year-old Annie Clements had seen enough of the world to know that it was unfair. She\u2019s spent her whole life in the copper-mining town of Calumet, Michigan where men risk their lives for meager salaries\u2014and had barely enough to put food on the table and clothes on their backs. The women labor in the houses of the elite, and send their husbands and sons deep underground each day, dreading the fateful call of the company man telling them their loved ones aren\u2019t coming home. When Annie decides to stand up for herself, and the entire town of Calumet, nearly everyone believes she may have taken on more than she is prepared to handle. In Annie\u2019s hands lie the miners\u2019 fortunes and their health, her husband\u2019s wrath over her growing independence, and her own reputation as she faces the threat of prison and discovers a forbidden love. On her fierce quest for justice, Annie will discover just how much she is willing to sacrifice for her own independence and the families of Calumet. From one of the most versatile writers in contemporary fiction, this novel is an authentic and moving historical portrait of the lives of the men and women of the early 20th century labor movement, and of a turbulent, violent political landscape that may feel startlingly relevant to today.",

        "description": "With the Bologna Accords a bachelor-master-doctor curriculum has been introduced in various countries with the intention that students may enter the job market already at the bachelor level. Since financial Institutions provide non negligible job opportunities also for mathematicians, and scientists in general, it appeared to be appropriate to have a financial mathematics course already at the bachelor level in mathematics. Most mathematical techniques in use in financial mathematics are related to continuous time models and require thus notions from stochastic analysis that bachelor students do in general not possess. Basic notions and methodologies in use in financial mathematics can however be transmitted to students also without the technicalities from stochastic analysis by using discrete time (multi-period) models for which general notions from Probability suffice and these are generally familiar to students not only from science courses, but also from economics with quantitative curricula. There do not exists many textbooks for multi-period models and the present volume is intended to fill in this gap. It deals with the basic topics in financial mathematics and, for each topic, there is a theoretical section and a problem section. The latter includes a great variety of possible problems with complete solution.",

        "description": "\"I would sleep better if I knew that Bernanke, Geithner, Bachus, Sen. Tim Johnson, Obama and Romney all kept dog-eared copies of Kevin Mellyn's Broken Markets on their nightstands. . . . Mellyn's work is a fascinating, important, and eminently good read and should inform the debate on overhauling the U.S. and global financial regulatory systems and sustainable macro fiscal and monetary policy.\" --Eric Grover, in his review of Broken Markets in The American Banker Broken Markets allows the intelligent non-specialist to understand and navigate the ongoing worldwide aftermath of the 2008 financial market meltdown. The key theme of the book is how the leading financial institutions and the political leadership of the U.S. and European Union have failed us and set the stage for continued market turmoil. It explains what this means for investors, borrowers, society in general, and the financial-services industry. Former banker Kevin Mellyn focuses on providing readers with clear and simple explanations of the forces at work and the potential consequences for their future prosperity. As this book makes clear, what\u2019s coming is a world in which high structural unemployment and flat or declining real income is likely\u2014not to mention a diminished retirement financial safety net. The book therefore provides actionable information for protecting wealth and making prudent investment decisions in an economy that is nothing like the one that has sustained us for decades. As a forward-looking narrative about rapidly changing events and volatile markets and politics, Broken Markets will provide no single prediction about the future but rather describe alternative scenarios and provide the reader with signposts to watch out for in deciding which reality is actually unfolding. Unlike most books written by journalists on global finance, the scenarios and signposts described will be largely based on the lessons of financial and political history rather than breaking news. This book: Tells you in plain language how today\u2019s financial system threatens your livelihood and wealth Tells you why and how governments worldwide, with some notable exceptions, are taking actions likely to make things worse instead of better Explains how the leading financial institutions lost their way during the bubble years and how they can find the path back to prosperity and value to society Tells you what life will be like in a \u201cpost-finance\u201d economy and how you can protect your wealth",

This is followed by a short account of the Bank for International Settlements, which is also referred to in connection with the IMF and the IBRD. The rest of this introduction is devoted to some non-European attempts at economic integration (which have not yet been very successful) and to the regional development banks. 1.

        "description": "When a disabled veteran takes a new job as an attorney in a small Wyoming town, he is thrust into a mysterious murder case. \"James Chandler's experience as a lawyer and Army veteran shines in every page of his brilliant legal thrillers.\" --Jason Kasper, USA Today bestselling author Sam Johnstone was hoping for renewal when he took a job at a boutique law firm in rustic Wyoming. The mountains and streams of the west would be a refreshing, quiet place to start over after years of war and turmoil in his personal life. But after a local woman is brutally murdered, Sam realizes that things aren't so quiet in this rural American town. The accused is one Tommy Olsen, a known delinquent who had been sleeping with the victim. Sam is repulsed by the crime and wants nothing to do with the case, but meets with Tommy to make sure he has legal representation. Yet things are not as they seem. What begins as a cut-and-dry case becomes infinitely more complicated as new facts are uncovered, and Sam agrees to serve as Tommy's defense attorney. With the killer's identity still unknown, Sam is enveloped in the small-town politics and courtroom drama of a murder investigation that keeps getting more shocking. But if Sam can't uncover the truth, an innocent man might be punished...while the real killer watches from the shadows. From Wall Street Journal bestselling author James Chandler comes the riveting Sam Johnstone legal thriller series; perfect for fans of John Grisham, James Patterson, and C.J. Box. ______________________ \"Few seasoned authors can deliver what James Chandler has with his debut novel.

For years, Michael Collins evaded FBI Agent Frank Vatch and avoided prosecution for allegedly taking millions of dollars in client funds. He had quit the practice of law, burned his suits and ties in a glorious back-alley bonfire, and dropped out. He loved his life as a beach bum in Mexico, but the investigation was never closed. Always looking over his shoulder, he wasn\u2019t truly free.

He\u2019s fully aware that he may be placed under arrest, but there are others who also want revenge. He fears for his life and the lives of his friends. As the prosecutors close in, the only question is whether Michael Collins has one more trick up his sleeve or whether it's all over. He will need to leverage all his courtroom skills to get what he wants: a jury to unanimously find him \u201cNot Guilty.\u201d Don\u2019t wait to get your copy of the third book in the award-winning \u201cNo Time\u201d series.",

The Iraq and Afghanistan Wars introduced the concept of IEDs (Improvised Explosive Devices) and EFPs (Explosively Formed Penetrators) that seriously maim or kill. It appears that these bombs are still being made and utilized by terrorists overseas. Who is funding them? Could it possibly be a large global bank with a major branch in New York? Is a reverse money laundering scheme in place that allows money transactions to bypass Department of Justice sanctions? Deke and his colleagues\u2014co-counsel Michael Carey and investigators Carol Morris and Jake Rutledge\u2014set out to uncover the deceit and bring the white collar criminals to justice. With the help of Michael\u2019s friend and war veteran, Joel Hartbeck\u2014who first blows the whistle against the bank\u2014the Deketomis team quickly discovers that they may have tackled more than they bargained for. A dangerous right wing paramilitary group might be involved in protecting the bank\u2019s interests, and Hartbeck soon goes missing. As Deke\u2019s lawsuit progresses, the sudden appearance of IEDs and EFPs on US highways cause death and destruction. Who is behind this evil? Readers who devour the financial-action-legal thrillers of Joseph Finder, Stephen Frey, and James Grippando will enjoy Suspicious Activity.",

        "description": "Science and technology have long been regarded as important determinants of economic growth. Edwin Mansfield (1971, pp. 1- 2), a pioneer in the economics of technological change, noted: Technological change is an important, if not the most important, factor responsible for economic growth . . . without question, [it] is one of the most important determinants of the shape and evolution of the American economy. Science and technology are even more important in the \"new economy,\" with its greater emphasis on the role of intellectual property and knowledge transfer. Therefore, it is unfortunate that most individuals rarely have the opportunity to explore the economic implications of science and technology. As a result, the antecedents and consequences of technological change are poorly understood by many in the general public. This lack of understanding is reflected in a recent survey conducted by the National Science Board (2000), summarized in Science & Engineering Indicators. ' As shown in Table 1. 1, the findings of the survey indicated that many Americans, despite a high level of interests in such matters, are not as well-informed about technological issues as they are about other policy issues. As shown in the table, individuals self assess, based on a scale from 1 to 100, their interest in science and technology policy issues as being relatively high, yet they self assess their knowledge or informedness about these issues relatively lower.",

Pacific Rim countries are major consumers of international sports and domestic professional sports have expanded continuously over time. Nippon Professional Baseball and the Korean Baseball Organization are the second and third largest baseball leagues measured by attendance and revenue following Major League Baseball in the U.S. This book also includes event studies of team ownership, assessment of human capital markets, analysis of the relationship between attendance and competitive balance, the components of fan demand in common the world over, and business decisions concerning attendance and pricing. There is already demand for comprehensive study of the sports business in the Pacific Rim as witnessed by this growth. This book will be of interest of researchers studying and/or teaching in the fields of sports economics and sports management as well as a general audience interested in business governance around the world.",

GOETHE Since the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), which are analysed in Part 1, are spe cialized agencies linked by special agreements with the United Nations, a few words about the UN and two of the other specialized agencies, the Food and Agriculture Organization and the International Labour Organization, are called for. This is followed by a short account of the Bank for International Settlements, which is also referred to in connection with the IMF and the IBRD. The rest of this introduction is devoted to some non-European attempts at economic integration (which have not yet been very successful) and to the regional development banks. 1. The United Nations (UN) The United Nations comprises 159 countries (September 1986) which have accepted the Charter of the United Nations, which was signed at San Francisco on 26 June 1945 by fifty-one states and came into force on 24 October 1945. The aims of the organization include the maintenance of peace and security, the promotion of better standards of living and the encouragement of economic and social progress for all nations by means of international cooperation. The principal organs of the UN are: The General Assembly The Security Council The Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) The Trusteeship Council The International Court of Justice The Secretariat.",

        "description": "One man\u2019s journey. One man\u2019s descent into hell. You never know what you\u2019re made of until the world spins off its axis, and then you find out damned fast. This collection includes the full Soul Storm Series. It\u2019s dark, disturbing, and a difficult read. Even though I also write romance, there are no \u201chappy ever afters\u201d here. The books are also available as standalones. Not for readers under 18. Dark Prophecy: When the dream world spills its murky contents, everyone\u2019s worst nightmares roam free. Lara McInnis reads auras and flirts with an elusive ability to foretell the future. Ambivalent about her magic, she\u2019s done a fine job sidestepping most of it. After several patients\u2014and a student or two\u2014describe the same cataclysmic dream, ancient evil bursts its bounds, and she can\u2019t ignore her power anymore. Trevor Denoble shields his secrets with a stunning body and a boatload of British charm. The airline he works for folds. Lara\u2019s changing into someone he barely recognizes, and the rest of his carefully crafted life isn\u2019t in much better shape. Living in a world teetering on the edge of anarchy, Trevor and Lara face painful decisions. Her burgeoning paranormal ability scares the hell out of him. Meantime, she does her damnedest to survive her magic in a world gone mad. A world where the rules have changed and there\u2019s no one left to trust. Dark Pursuit: Old blood and ancient power defy evil so dark, deep, and menacing it destroys everything in its path. Widespread rioting, plus shortages of fuel, food, and electricity lure demons across the veil to invade Earth. Drawn by anarchy, they\u2019re out of control, drunk on their own power, and growing stronger by the day. With her life crumbling around her, Lara McInnis is reluctantly roped into channeling her psychic talents to locate a missing teen. Her lack of skill strands her in the murky underbelly of a world inhabited by dark forces. Trevor Denoble\u2019s Celtic blood yields unexpected gifts. After years of uncertainty, Lara is really and truly finally his, and he\u2019s determined to keep her by his side. No stranger to violence, more blood on his hands is a small price to pay to keep the woman he loves safe. Dark Promise: Some choices tear your heart out, but they can never be undone. Lara and Trevor flee Seattle in the wake of rising chaos. Demons converge on what\u2019s left of civilization, urging it to implode even faster. Constantly hungry, besieged by dark forces, Lara and Trevor need every resource they\u2019ve developed as a couple to keep from ripping each other apart. Neither of them trust Lara\u2019s half-baked magic, but it\u2019s all that stands between survival and certain death for them and their unborn child. The remote location that was supposed to solve all their problems actually made them worse. Rash choices throw Trevor into a confrontation with his deepest fears, but he doesn\u2019t back down. Lara\u2019s life hangs in the balance, and he\u2019ll do anything to get her back. Anything. PRAISE FOR THE SOUL STORM SERIES: \u201d This book is amazing. It was well written, and it also makes you wonder if this will soon come to pass. I love how you get hooked right from the beginning.\u201d Goodreads review \u201cOne simply does not read this book to while a way a few hours. You are pulled into the vortex of the author's imagination. You can see, hear, feel what Lara and Trevor are experiencing.\u201d Goodreads review \u201cVery deep and thought provoking. Not at all what I was expecting but was immediately hooked.\u201d Goodreads review \u201cSuch a wonderful read!! I totally fell in love with the characters and their story.

Do you wonder why you live your life as you do and as nature and evolution had intended? \"The Human Equation and the Prime Directive\" is a book that belongs to every seeker. It answers the universal question, \"Where did we come from and where are we going?\" Hassan Rasheed reveals a way to read the patterns in the sand of life's depth of meaning. This book is an analysis of life, its direction and future on Earth in general and the role of humans in particular. It starts with the origin of life and its Prime Directive followed by the relationship between it and energy. It covers how belief systems support life's prime directive through the promotion of unity and cooperation. It ends with revelations about how all this will fair for the Earth and its inhabitants.",

Does brute nature unfold a history? Does human history have a telos? Does human existence have a purpose? Phenomenology of life projects a new interrogative system for reexamining these questions. We are invited to follow the logos of life as it spins in innumerable ways the interplay of natural factors, human passions, social forces, science and experience \u2013 through interruptions and kairic moments of accomplishment \u2013 in the human creative imagination and intellective reasoning. There then run a cohesive thread of reality.",

        "description": "Digital technologies are deeply embedded in everyday life with opportunities for information access and perpetual social contact now mediating most of our activities and relationships. This book expands the lens of Cyberpsychology to consider how digital experiences play out across the various stages of people\u2019s lives. Most psychological research has focused on whether human-technology interactions are a \u2018good\u2019 or a \u2018bad\u2019 thing for humanity. This book offers a distinctive approach to the emergent area of Cyberpsychology, moving beyond these binary dilemmas and considering how popular technologies have come to frame human experience and relationships. In particular the authors explore the role of significant life stages in defining the evolving purpose of digital technologies. They discuss how people\u2019s symbiotic relationship with digital technologies has started to redefine our childhoods, how we experience ourselves, how we make friends, our experience of being alone, how we have sex and form romantic relationships, our capacity for being antisocial as well as the experience of growing older and dying. This interdisciplinary book will be of great interest to scholars and practitioners across psychology, digital technology and media studies as well as anyone interested in how technology influences our behaviour.",

In a fascinating account, the author integrates the history of philosophy of mind and phenomenology with recent discoveries on the neuroscience of conscious states. The reader can trace the development of a neuro-philosophical synthesis through the work of Aristotle, Kant, Wittgenstein, Husserl, Merleau-Ponty, Brentano and Hughlings-Jackson, among others, and so explore contemporary philosophical puzzles surrounding consciousness and its relation to cerebral synchrony and connectedness. Of interest to students and scholars of neuroethics, neurophilosophy and philosophy of mind, as well as philosophy of psychiatry, From Aristotle to Neuroscience demonstrates the real essence of consciousness as it increasingly connects with philosophy, law, morality, aesthetics, and spirituality.",

        "description": "We are not human beings that have spiritual experiences. We are truly spiritual beings that are currently having a human experience. In The Road to Freedom: Letting Go of Your Baggage, Peter Allman explains that our primary purpose is to create a divine union between our human essence and our spiritual essence and provides the road map for doing so. The ego is the main reason the divine union does not occur. The ego is a way of thinking. It is a mind - a mindset - that is built on the absence of the Divine and creates a false sense of self. The ego mind sees the world in terms of \"I want this\" or \"I don't want this.\" The three letters of ego could stand for \"edging God out.\" People of all faiths have a prayer that is similar to \"Not my will, but Thy will be done.\" \"My will\" equates to the ego. \"Thy will\" equates to our spiritual nature. It is said we need to live in the world but not be of the world. We need human strengths to live \"in the world.\" Because we have a great capacity to subvert the will of God to our own, we need to access our spiritual nature to be able to \"not be of the world.\"",

        "description": "Since the height of the privatization debate in the 1990s, changes in government policy have resulted in significant transformation in the public sector. Some organizations have made the transition from government bureaucracy to business venture successfully; others have struggled to relinquish their traditional bureaucratic culture. In this book, Pillay and Bilney explore the cultural changes occurring within the public sector and the effects that government mandated change initiatives have actually had. The culmination of this book was due to the subject expertise and guidance of Professor Robert Jones at Swinburne University of Technology, Melbourne, Australia. It provides perspectives on the efficacy of cultural change in the Australian public sector, and explores the practical implications for society and government as it seeks to entrench the culture of the citizen as customer. It is particularly useful for researchers and organizations searching for ways to improve service delivery within the confines of particular market positions.",

        "description": "In this book Eileen Trauth peers inside the day-to-day work lives of the people who have been bringing about Ireland's transition from a small agricultural country to a healthy information economy. It is one of few book-length interpretive studies in the information systems field. This book links the disciplines of information systems, international management, economic development, history, and public policy to tell the story behind the statistics about Ireland's economic development. The findings from this ten-year study illustrate the range of socio-cultural factors, which influence the emergence of an information sector. Ireland's story contains a message for other nations that this change to a new way of working and living is intimately connected to the cultural context within which it occurs. This book reveals the ethnographic approach that was used by taking the reader through the interpretive process as it occurred. The Appendix is devoted to additional detail about the methodology. Audience: This book should be read by PhD students and others who want to learn more about the actual application of ethnographic methods in information systems research. It should be read by students, researchers, teachers, and policy-makers working in several fields including global information systems, the information society, management in the knowledge economy, and economic development.",

It also studies how intertwined company practices and the Chinese culture are, and how this relationship affects the business environment in China. Further, it highlights the value of economic factors in corporate social responsibility, and the influence of Chinese philosophy on corporate ethics. It is a valuable tool for researchers and academics wishing to understand the dynamics of corporate social responsibility in China and discover the significant influencing factors in China's business arena.",

        "description": "This book argues that ideas in the social realm are the context-bound products of distinct histories and cultures and thus cannot be co-opted across place and time. When ideas are used out of context, they become mere empty words that are depicted as absolute ideals, independent of the specific historical circumstances in which they were conceived. Therefore, highly ideologically guidelines based on one-size-fits-all principles are doomed to fail. The book emphasizes that the dominant Western intellectual paradigm has not improved human society in either Western or non-Western parts of the world. Some of the book's objectives are to rethink the dominant paradigm and invent a new world. We face an existential crisis that requires a new vision of the world and its well-being: one that is more inclusive and attentive to the diversity of people, histories, and cultures. We must remember that diversity in beliefs and values is the very essence of our humanity. This seminal work is essential reading for researchers of economic growth and development, political science, and innovation.",

        "description": "Medicine and business management share certain similarities, writes John Kay. For centuries, the theories behind medical practice were mostly nonsense. Doctors simply applied fashionable nostrums, bleeding one patient, starving another, and sometimes the patient got better, sometimes not. The prestige of a doctor rested more on the social rank of his patients and the confidence of his assertions than on the evidence of his cures. Much the same can be said of present-day management gurus. But there is one difference between medicine and management, Kay adds. In the last 100 years, medicine has been transformed by science. Management has not. In The Business of Economics, Kay argues that it is economics that can provide the science that management presently lacks, that economics is the natural backbone of business management. In the many insightful and lively pieces collected here, Kay looks at the application of economics to the central strategic issues facing firms--their choice of activities and markets. He is particularly interested in microeconomics, the study of markets, industries, and firms, and is on the other hand highly critical of macroeconomics, economic modeling, and economic forecasting (which he says is inevitably wrong). He is especially illuminating on the recently developed resource-based theory of strategy, which attempts to explain the success or failure of a firm in terms of its \"distinctive capabilities\" (the factors which differentiate them from others in the same market and which cannot be easily reproduced by competitors even when recognized.) For instance, BMW's highly skilled work force, due to Germany's high level of general education, is hard to reproduce by competitors in other countries. Kay shows how BMW exploited its highly skilled labor force (opposed to low-wage foreign workers or robots found in many other auto plants) to get a large share of the market for up-scale, high-performance cars. Among the many other topics discussed in this idea-rich book are Saatchi & Saatchi's dismal attempt to globalize in the 1980s, Honda's great success selling low-end motorcycles in the U.S., the fare of the Eurotunnel, and the reason why race-car driver Nigel Mansell makes seventy-five times as much money a year as Britain's Prime Minister, John Major. Described in Business Age as the \"most important business analyst in Britain bar none,\" John Kay is renowned for his incisive, entertaining, and controversial columns in the Financial Times of London. In addition, he is a regular commentator on radio and TV, and is in much demand as a speaker and consultant. In The Business of Economics, he shares his thoughts on a wide range of issues facing businesses today. His clear and down-to-earth writing style informs, challenges, and entertains, and his rigorous and clever analysis of the corporate world offers insights into the business problems and decisions faced by executives and managers every day.",

BETRAYAL Forced to Northumberland to care for her dying Aunt, Charley Costin is determined to put aside childhood fears, and a twenty year feud, to prove her family wrong. Elizabeth Kane is not a witch, she is just an old lady, and Charley intends to make her estranged Aunt's last days as comfortable as possible. But doubts creep in when Elizabeth proves more work than Charley ever imagined. Intimidating and demanding, with violent hallucinations, episodes of paranoia, and an agenda of her own, Charley discovers dementia is much more than loss of memory, and her Aunt is as far from 'old lady' as she can get. Already on edge, Charley discovers Fortwind House hides not only a sinister presence, an unruly bell, and a study door that opens itself, but also a terrible secret. A secret that gardener Axl Maddox would kill to keep buried. A secret that Elizabeth is desperate to tell. As her Aunt's paranoia grows, an unnerved Charley questions just how long her Aunt has left, and the real reason she may have less time than she thinks. Disturbed, watched, and afraid, Charley feels out of her depth as over twenty years of deception, betrayal, vengeance, and bad blood rise to the surface with devastating consequences. What Charley discovers at Fortwind House will blow her world apart and challenge everything she has ever known. SHATTERED \u2018From the 1st page, I was hooked, and kept finding spare minutes so I could sit and read Shattered, I so wanted it to end, but I didn't want it to finish!!\u2019 Amazon review.",

But there's more to Solom than she ever imagined. Gordon Smith's first wife Rebecca died under mysterious circumstances, and Katy believes her spirit is still in the house. Gordon's great-grandfather was a horseback preacher who vanished while on a mission one wintry night, and local lore holds that he returns from time to time seeking vengeance. And Gordon teases Katy and Jett with a story about a wicked scarecrow that comes in from the fields at night to slake an unnatural thirst. When the legends come to life, Katy and Jett discover the Smith family secrets cut deep. And they must face the supernatural menace together or become part of Solom's legends forever.

Strap yourself in for the third installment of award-winning author Alan Baxter's unrelenting Eli Carver Supernatural Thriller Series. Praise for Alan Baxter's Ghost Recall and the Eli Carver Supernatural Thrillers: \"Ghost Recall [Book Three] bottles the essence of impending doom that drives the most powerful noir. Vintage Baxter: fast, sleek, and bloody-minded.\"\u2014 Laird Barron, author of Swift to Chase \"[Book One] Manifest Recall grabs you by the scruff of the neck from word one and doesn't let go. It's fast paced, bad people doing bad things to other bad people. I gobbled it down in two nights. You should, too. Highly recommended!\" \u2013 John F.D. Taff, Bram Stoker Award-nominated author of The Fearing \"Eli Carver is back with a vengeance! That's bad news for some but good news for readers. [Book Two] Recall Night is brutal, gritty fun and a phenomenal follow-up to Manifest Recall.\" \u2014 Brian Keene, author of The Complex \"Alan Baxter's fiction is dark, disturbing, hard-hitting and heart-breakingly honest. He reflects on worlds known and unknown with compassion, and demonstrates an almost second-sight into human behaviour.\" \u2013 Kaaron Warren, Shirley Jackson Award-winner and author of The Grief Hole \"Alan's work is reminiscent of that of Clive Barker and Jim C. Hines, but with a unique flavour all of its own.\" \u2013 Angela Slatter, World Fantasy, British Fantasy and Aurealis Award winner Grey Matter Press, the multiple Bram Stoker Award-nominated independent publisher, is proud to present the third installment in one of the best supernatural thriller series ever imagined.

Ulysses Grant in his Memoirs gives us a unique glimpse of someone who found that the habit of reflection could serve as a force multiplier for leadership.\u201d \u2014Thomas E. Ricks, Foreign Policy Ulysses S. Grant\u2019s memoirs, sold door-to-door by former Union soldiers, were once as ubiquitous in American households as the Bible. Mark Twain and Henry James hailed them as great literature, and countless presidents credit Grant with influencing their own writing. This is the first comprehensively annotated edition of Grant\u2019s memoirs, clarifying the great military leader\u2019s thoughts on his life and times through the end of the Civil War and offering his invaluable perspective on battlefield decision making. With annotations compiled by the editors of the Ulysses S. Grant Association\u2019s Presidential Library, this definitive edition enriches our understanding of the pre-war years, the war with Mexico, and the Civil War. Grant provides essential insight into how rigorously these events tested America\u2019s democratic institutions and the cohesion of its social order. \u201cWhat gives this peculiarly reticent book its power? Above all, authenticity... Grant\u2019s style is strikingly modern in its economy.\u201d \u2014T. J. Stiles, New York Times \u201cIt\u2019s been said that if you\u2019re going to pick up one memoir of the Civil War, Grant\u2019s is the one to read.

Following the rhythms of life from childhood through old age, Editor Leet arranges the selections so readers view the meanins of life through others' eyes, observing the influences and the inspirations, the challenges and the crises, the struggles and the successes that shape people and their destinies. In these pages we are admitted to the close company of another's mind and spirit - to discover and experience a totally different life - the life of an heiress, of a child prodigy, of an anthropologist, of a vice president thrust unexpectedly into the presidency, of those who require solitude, and of those who demand activity. We also gain perspective on the range of motivations people have for writing their autobiographies: from the vanity that propelled Ben Franklin to record his rise, to the intensity of diarist Anne Frank's loneliness and the honet self-examination of writer may Sarton.",

Just when you thought that it was safe to start showing off again, John Lloyd and John Mitchinson are back with another busload of mistakes and misunderstandings. Here is a new collection of simple, perfectly obvious questions you'll be quite certain you know the answers to. Whether it's history, science, sports, geography, literature, language, medicine, the classics, or common wisdom, you'll be astonished to discover that everything you thought you knew is still hopelessly wrong. For example, do you know who made the first airplane flight? How many legs does an octopus have? How much water should you drink every day? What is the chance of tossing a coin and it landing on heads? What happens if you leave a tooth in a glass of Coke overnight? What is house dust mostly made from? What was the first dishwasher built to do? What color are oranges? Who in the world is most likely to kill you? Whatever your answers to the questions above, you can be sure that everything you think you know is wrong. The Second Book of General Ignorance is the essential text for everyone who knows they don't know everything, and an ideal stick with which to beat people who think they do.",

        "description": "The Government Inspector, also known as The Inspector General , is a satirical play by the Russophone Ukrainian playwright and novelist Nikolai Gogol. Originally published in 1836, the play was revised for an 1842 edition. Based upon an anecdote allegedly recounted to Gogol by Pushkin, the play is a comedy of errors, satirizing human greed, stupidity, and the extensive political corruption of Imperial Russia. According to D. S. Mirsky, the play \"is not only supreme in character and dialogue in it is one of the few Russian plays constructed with unerring art from beginning to end. The great originality of its plan consisted in the absence of all love interest and of sympathetic characters. The latter feature was deeply resented by Gogol's enemies, and as a satire the play gained immensely from it. There is not a wrong word or intonation from beginning to end, and the comic tension is of a quality that even Gogol did not always have at his beck and call. The dream-like scenes of the play, often mirroring each other, whirl in the endless vertigo of self-deception around the main character, Khlestakov, who personifies irresponsibility, light-mindedness, absence of measure. \"He is full of meaningless movement and meaningless fermentation incarnate, on a foundation of placidly ambitious inferiority\" (D.S. Mirsky). The publication of the play led to a great outcry in the reactionary press. It took the personal intervention of Tsar Nicholas I to have the play staged, with Mikhail Shchepkin taking the role of the Mayor.",

Challenging what most of us assume to be verifiable truths in areas like history, literature, science, nature, and more,The Book of General Ignorance is a witty \u201cgotcha\u201d compendium of how little we actually know about anything. It\u2019ll have you scratching your head wondering why we even bother to go to school. Think Magellan was the first man to circumnavigate the globe, baseball was invented in America, Henry VIII had six wives, Mount Everest is the tallest mountain? Wrong, wrong, wrong, and wrong again. You\u2019ll be surprised at how much you don\u2019t know! Check out The Book of General Ignorance for more fun entries and complete answers to the following: How long can a chicken live without its head? About two years. What do chameleons do? They don\u2019t change color to match the background. Never have; never will. Complete myth. Utter fabrication. Total Lie. They change color as a result of different emotional states. How many legs does a centipede have? Not a hundred. How many toes has a two-toed sloth? It\u2019s either six or eight. Who was the first American president? Peyton Randolph. What were George Washington\u2019s false teeth made from? Mostly hippopotamus. What was James Bond\u2019s favorite drink? Not the vodka martini.",

The authors present a variety of approaches and perspectives that reflect cutting-edge advances in psychological science. Cognition and Neuropsychology is dedicated to summarizing and characterizing the current scientific research in three substantive content areas, (i) Perception, Attention, and Action, (ii) Social Cognition, and (iii) Learning, Memory and Development. While some of the contributions focus on relatively narrow areas of research, others adopt a much broader stance, trying to understand and explain many different facets of behaviour across widely differing situations. Some contributions even try to bridge the fundamental gap between behaviour and genetics. The final part contains two chapters that discuss fundamental general issues in psychology, such as the fate of mentalism and the significance of phenomenal analyses. All chapters offer fascinating insights into current theorizing on the mind, and are written by some of the best-known scholars of our time. This book will be an invaluable resource for researchers, professionals, teachers and students in the field of psychology.",

        "description": "From the Foreword: \"Is it possible at present to identify a core cluster of theoretical ideas, concepts, and methods with which everyone working in the area of learning and cognition needs to be familiar? Would it be possible to make explicit the relationships that we feel do or must exist among the various subspecialties, ranging from conditioning through perceptual learning and memory to psycholinguistics, and to present these in a sufficiently organized way to help specialists and non-specialists alike in relating particular lines of research to the broader spectrum of activity? These questions were posed to a substantial number of investigators who are currently most active in developing the ideas and doing the research. Their response constitutes this Handbook...\" First published in 1975, Volume 1 of this Handbook attempts to present an overview of the field and to introduce the principal theoretical and methodological issues that will persistently recur in the expanded treatments of specific research areas that comprise the later volumes. Deferring to the current Zeitgeist rather than to chronology, they begin with the present state of cognitive psychology, then introduce the comparative approach, and conclude this volume with a rapid, three-chapter review of the evolution of ideas from conditioning to information processing.",

Each chapter of this volume reports the most recent research by a leading researcher on the international stage. Topics include the effects on thought, emotion, and behavior by limitations in working memory, cognitive control, attention, inhibition, and reasoning processes. Other chapters review standard and emerging research paradigms and new findings on limitations in cognitive functioning associated with aging and psychopathology. The explicit goal behind this volume was to facilitate cross-area research and training by familiarizing researchers with paradigms and findings in areas different from but related to their own.",

Learning and cognition is the foundation of cognitive psychology and encompasses many topics including attention, memory, categorization, etc. Most books in the area either focus on one subtopic in-depth (e.g. an entire book on memory) or cover the gamut of subjects in a series of long, technical handbook-like chapters. This concise reference offers researchers and professors teaching in the area a new take on the material that is comprehensive in breadth, but lighter in depth - focusing on main findings, established facts, and minimizing the amount of space taken up by large, multi-volume references.

Broad in scope without sacrificing depth of detail, this text emphasizes the link between conceptual cognitive psychology and real-world experience; case studies, current trends, and historical perspectives merge to provide a comprehensive understanding of core principles and theories.

        "description": "David Neth\u2019s urban fantasy series follows sister witches Samantha and Kathy as they face mythical creatures, monsters, spirits, and more magical foes. This bundle contains Harpy, Siren, and Valkyrie, books 1, 2, and 3 in the Coven series. Harpy Saving him is their job, but it won\u2019t get his victim justice. Samantha and Kathy are witches who protect the nonmagical from evil. So when they spot a coven of harpies targeting Mark, a nonmagical man, they immediately rush to save him. With the threat of the harpies still looming over Mark, the sisters learn more about him and the target on his back. Namely, that the harpies are hunting him to drag him to hell to pay for his crimes against a young woman. However, that presents a dilemma for Samantha and Kathy: do they follow their duties as witches and save the man who harmed a young woman or do they step aside and let the harpies drag him to hell to pay for those crimes? The clock is ticking and the longer it takes Samantha and Kathy to decide what to do, the more innocent people that will be hurt by the harpies while they wait to sink their claws into Mark. Harpy is the first book in the Coven series, which serves as a prequel series to the Under the Moon series. Siren Sometimes betrayal is just one small act\u2026 While scouting possible wedding locations on Presque Isle, Samantha and Kathy cast a spell to prevent a man from driving his boat right onto shore. Shrugging it off as a close call, the sisters return their focus to their lives: Samantha\u2019s upcoming wedding, and Kathy\u2019s struggling personal and professional life. However, their little diversion spell ignites the fury of Heather, a siren who lives to sway men in loving relationships into a fiery betrayal that results in their death. She turns her attention to the men in the witches\u2019 lives as payback for foiling her plan on Presque Isle. After several close calls, Samantha and Kathy force their boyfriends to coexist in one house so they can protect them, but the siren\u2019s attacks keep hitting closer to home. With tensions rising in the overcrowded house and everyone almost at their breaking point, the witches must find a way to stop Heather before she can succeed in her mission to kill their men. Siren is the second book in the Coven series, which serves as a prequel series to the Under the Moon series. Valkyrie The end of the world might be sooner than they think. The valkyries secretly hand-select fallen heroes to bring back to Valhalla to prepare for the final battle. While out at a nightclub, Kathy witnesses a valkyrie collect a dying man\u2019s soul. Thinking the valkyrie is doing harm, she tries to fight her off, but loses. Back in Valhalla, the valkyries view their lapse in secrecy as a sign that the final battle is beginning. They capture Kathy and bring her back to Valhalla while they rally their army to send into battle. Meanwhile, Samantha is reeling from having told Steven she\u2019s a witch. But when she discovers Kathy\u2019s gone missing, she puts her strained relationship aside to save her sister, only to end up in just as much danger as Kathy. With the valkyries preparing for war, Samantha and Kathy must prove that they mean no harm in order to return to their normal lives. But the end of the world might be sooner than they think. Valkyrie is the third book in the Coven series, which serves as a prequel series to the Under the Moon series.

The conference is held annually as the major event in this arena. Being the largest and the most authoritative international academic conference held in China, it provides an academic platform for experts and entrepreneurs in the areas of international industrial engineering and management to exchange their research findings. Many experts in various fields from China and around the world gather together at the conference to review, exchange, summarize and promote their achievements in the fields of industrial engineering and engineering management. For example, some experts pay special attention to the current state of the application of related techniques in China as well as their future prospects, such as green product design, quality control and management, supply chain and logistics management to address the need for, amongst other things low-carbon, energy-saving and emission-reduction. They also offer opinions on the outlook for the development of related techniques. The proceedings offers impressive methods and concrete applications for experts from colleges and universities, research institutions and enterprises who are engaged in theoretical research into industrial engineering and engineering management and its applications. As all the papers are of great value from both an academic and a practical point of view, they also provide research data for international scholars who are investigating Chinese style enterprises and engineering management.",

        "description": "The basic idea of the real-time enterprise is to become quicker. A business which wants to become a real-time enterprise has to acquire three main abilities: - Internal and external data is integrated quickly and in real time in a well-organized company data pool, - Analyses of information in the company data pool can be obtained in real time, across function boundaries and at the touch of a button, - The number of working steps performed in batch mode is shifting dramatically in favor of immediate completion in real time. The issue of communications - or real-time communications - plays a special role here. Studies have shown that processing times sometimes double when necessary communication events are handled in batch mode in the business process and not in real time. In other words, when an activity cannot be completed and lies around for days because an urgently needed partner cannot be contacted. The necessity of acquiring these three abilities has implications for the process-related, technical and organizational aspects of a business that are dealt with in detail in this book.",

        "description": "The ping-pong diplomacy and its aftermath discussion, coupled with the entry of communist China into the United Nations and the subsequent expulsion of Taiwan, will generate considerable political dialogue about the changing balance of power and the fate of the other China. These political discussions will obviously overshadow the true role and function of the existence of Taiwan. Given the time, Taiwan could become a model for the development process for other emerging countries. Taiwan's experience with eco nomic development has real relevance for many countries. For exam ple, in less than two decades Taiwan has achieved the industrial and economic growth that should well make it the envy of nearly all other developing nations. Its per capita income is exceeded only by Japan among the countries of the Far East. Yet, despite vigorous economic and industrial growth, obvious breakdowns in this economic progress come into view. The lack of managerial input threatens to become a real bottleneck. The study reported in this volume examines the feasibility and utility of transferring advanced management know-how and practices into the industrial enterprises in Taiwan in order to generate further economic and industrial growth. The study itself concerns management practices and effectiveness of American subsidiaries, Japanese sub sidiaries, and comparable local firms in Taiwan.",

The first of two volumes for the decade, it presents a colourful mosaic of twentieth-century Australian life. It contains biographies of well-known identities such as Sir Henry Bolte, Sir Robert Askin, Sir Reginald Ansett, Sir Macfarlane Burnet, Sir Raphael and Lady Cilento, Sir Arthur Coles, Robert Holmes-O-Court, Sir Warwick Fairfax, Sir Edmund Herring, Albert Facey, Donald Friend, Sir Roy Grounds, Sir Bernard Heinze and Sir Robert Helpmann. Eminent Australian women in the volume include Dame Elizabeth Couchman, Dame Kate Campbell, Dame Doris Fitton, Dame Zara Holt and Lady (Maie) Casey. Although many of the women achieved prominence in those professions conventionally regarded as the preserve of women, othersandmdash;such as Ruby Boye-Jones, coast-watcher; Ellen Cashman, union organiser; Elsie Chauvel, film-maker; Dorothy Crawford, radio producer; Ruth Dobson, diplomat; Mary Hodgkin, anthropologist; Margaret Kelly, restaurateur; and Patricia Jarrett, journalistandmdash;demonstrate that some women at least were breaking free of the constraints of traditional expectations. The lives of fifteen Indigenous Australians are included, as are those of a number of immigrants who fled from persecution in Europe to establish a new life in Australia.",

Nico will come along as my fake boyfriend to convince the Faerieland King that I've moved on. Sounds like hell. But when my former flame suddenly becomes an online sensation and my connection to the serial killer goes public\u2014jetting off to Faerieland with my ex-husband and the werewolf fake boyfriend (I might have real feelings for) sounds like a vacation. What could possible go wrong? We just gotta remember the Faerieland rules: Don't eat anything. Don't make any bargains. And just like everywhere else\u2014sometimes it's kill or be killed.

Today's example: Takeout. What could be so terrible about takeout? Normally, it was awesome. I lived on the stuff. I read the menus like the bible. But this wasn't that kind of takeout. I stared at the Styrofoam containers on the table. My stomach was already cringing, looking for a place to hide. The containers gleamed virgin white under the fluorescent lights of the FBI conference room, but their contents were not quite so pure. Each carton had a handwritten label on top. One read, Marion\u2014bright and charming. Another read Stacey\u2014good body. The last, Eileen\u2014agreeable. The writing was large with strong vertical strokes and half-closed loops.

They all feature in this enthralling compendium of Chinese fairy tales and legends, along with an array of equally colourful characters and captivating plots. Although largely unknown in the West, the 70-plus stories in this volume are just as beguiling as the more familiar Grimms' Fairy Tales or Arabian Nights. They were collected in the early 20th century by Richard Wilhelm and first translated into English by Frederick H Martens. This beautifully produced revised and edited new edition includes updated notes which not only provide background on the tales, but also offer a fascinating insight into ancient Chinese folk lore and culture. These are stories to return to time and time again. From awesome adventures to quirky allegories, from the exploits of the gods to fables about beggars who outwit their betters, Chinese Fairy Tales and Legends is extraordinarily diverse and endlessly engaging. These wonderful stories have enduring and universal appeal, and will intrigue both children and adults.",

        "description": "Originally published in French, Fairy Tales of the Slav Peasants and Herdsmen features 20 folk tales from the Slavic countries and territories. Very few of the 20 fairy tales included in this volume have been presented before in an English dress; this will doubtless enhance their value in the eyes of the young folk, for whom, principally, they are intended. Herein you will find tales like The Twelve Months - the story of Marouckla, who is set seemingly impossible tasks by her stepmother, but with the help of the Twelve Months overcomes and succeeds. The Lost Child \u2013 the story of a childless Noble couple who pray earnestly for a child. Their wish is granted with one condition \u2013 that that the child\u2019s feet never touched the earth until it was twelve years old\u2026\u2026 Then you have the stories of The Sovereign of the Mineral Kingdom, Ohnivak, Tears of Pearls, Kinkach Martinko and many more. The Slav race is considerably diverse, both genetically and culturally. Famous Slavs in recent times are Pope John Paul II, the first human astronaut Yuri Gagarin, former President of Russia Mikhail Gorbachev and electrician/inventor Nikola Tesla. In earlier times Slavic groups also migrated as far North as Scandinavia, and constituted elements amongst the Vikings; whilst at the other geographic extreme, Slavic mercenaries fighting for the Byzantines and Arabs settled Asia Minor and even as far East as Syria. Fairy Tales of the Slav Peasants and Herdsmen was a French collection of the beloved fairy tales passed from generation to generation, and the stories were collected for preservation by Chodzko. Emily Harding, also known as Emily Harding Andrews, published her English translation in 1896, Harding was an illustrator for the woman\u2019s suffrage movement, and frequent illustrator of children\u2019s books. Fairy Tales of the Slav Peasants and Herdsmen was the first book she had translated and published under her own name. The accompanying 55 illustrations and headpieces speak for themselves, and are what might have been expected from the artist of her calibre. So sit back in a comfy chair with a cup of hot chocolate and enjoy these forgotten tales, lost to Western readers for over 100 years.",

When he came to where they were, he wouldn't speak, but went straight into the castle, and wouldn't eat or drink. He was sad and lamenting for a good while, till at last he disappeared one day, the king and queen knew not whither. After that they didn't hear of him,\u00d1didn't know was he dead or alive. The young man after he left home was walking along over the kingdom for a long time. One day he saw no house, big or little, till after dark he came in front of a hill, and at the foot of the hill saw a small light. He went to the light, found a small house, and inside an old woman sitting at a warm fire, and every tooth in her head as long as a staff. She stood up when he entered, took him by the hand, and said, \"You are welcome to my house, son of the king of Erin.\" Then she brought warm water, washed his feet and legs from the knees down, gave him supper, and put him to bed. When he rose next morning he found breakfast ready before him. The old woman said: \"You were with me last night; you'll be with my sister to-night, and what she tells you to do, do, or your head'll be in danger. Now take the gift I give you. Here is a ball of thread: do you throw it in front of you before you start, and all day the ball will be rolling ahead of you, and you'll be following behind winding the thread into another ball.\" He obeyed the old woman, threw the ball down, and followed. All the day he was going up hill and down, across valleys and open places, keeping the ball in sight and winding the thread as he went, till evening, when he saw a hill in front, and a small light at the foot of it.",

        "description": "Herein you will find 34 folk and fairy tales from the Hawaiian Islands. Of special note is the section on the MENEHUNES, or fairy folk, of Hawaii. Unsurprisingly the islands are often referred to as the Home of the Brownies. You will also find the tales of AI KANAKA; A LEGEND OF MOLOKAI, MAUI SNARING THE SUN, THE LOCATION OF THE LUA O MILU, KALELEALUAKA, LAKA'S ADVENTURE, KEKUPUA'S CANOE, THE BATTLE OF THE OWLS and many, many more. If you have interest in the native Hawaiian people, and indeed the Polynesian race as a whole, then you will do well to include this book in your library. However, if you are seeking m\u00e4rchen, different to the usual European diet of princes on white stallions dashing in to save a beautiful princess, then this volume is bound to keep you captivated for hours as well. This book was created in response to repeated requests from the public. The compiler, Thomas. G. Thrum, therefore presented in book form the series of legends that have were made a feature of \"The Hawaiian Annual\", originally published as early as 1875 and through to the 1970\u2019s. The series has been enriched by the addition of several tales, the famous shark legend having been furnished for this purpose from the papers of the Hawaiian Historical Society. In similar vein Abela Publishing has also published \u201cThe Legends of Maui\u201d a book containing the 15 legends of Maui\u2019s exploits and adventures, under ISBN: 9781907256950. A second volume of Polynesian folklore is Polynesian Mythology Ancient Traditional History Of The New Zealanders (phew!) has been published under ISBN: 9781907256318 and has a shorter sub-title of Maori Folklore. The book contains 23 Maori myths and legends collected by Sir George Grey and published in 1945. Sir George Grey was twice appointed Governor General of New Zealand firstly from 1845 to 1853, and again from 1861 to 1868. He was later elected Prime Minister. So accurate was Sir George\u2019s translations of Maori folklore that he was able to use the precedents in the folklore of this volume to settle disputes amongst the Maori. 33% of the net profit from the sale of this book will be donated to charities.

It draws on both established findings and cutting edge research. The material is presented in a jargon-free, easy to understand manner and aims to guide students new to the field through current areas of research. John Stirling's Introducing Neuropsychology not only covers brain function but gives clinical examples of what happens when this function is damaged. The text deals firstly with the basics of neuropsychology, discussing the structures of the central nervous system and methods of research used in neuropsychology. The book covers sensory function, the lateral nature of the brain and motor control and movement disorders. The author then looks at higher order cortical functions, with chapters on language, memory and amnesia, visual object recognition and spatial processing and attention. A further chapter covers executive function and describes some psychiatric disorders resulting from dysfunction. With over 80 illustrations John Stirling has provided a user-friendly textbook, which will be essential reading for those studying neuropsychology within the disciplines of psychology, medicine, clinical psychology and neuroscience.",

Yet the field faces the challenges of establishing evidence-based linkages between assessment and interventions and of broadening its approaches to culturally diverse populations. Edited by a leading expert in school neuropsychology, Best Practices in School Neuropsychology: Guidelines for Effective Practice, Assessment, and Evidence-Based Intervention addresses these challenges and their solutions and provides learning specialists and school psychologists with clear coverage and vital information on this burgeoning area of practice within school psychology. This insightful reference features comprehensive discussion of: Current school neuropsychological assessment and intervention models Best practices in assessing cognitive processes An overview of what neuroscience offers to the practice of school neuropsychology How school neuropsychology fits within a Response to Intervention (RTI) model The rationale for the importance of school psychologists\u2019 collaboration with parents, educators, and other professionals to maximize services to children Clinical applications of school neuropsychology with special populations, academic disabilities, processing deficits, and medical disorders Unique challenges in working with culturally diverse populations Featuring contributions from internationally renowned school psychologists, neuropsychologists, clinicians, and academics, Best Practices in School Neuropsychology is the first book of its kind to present best practices and evidence-informed guidelines for the assessment and intervention of children with learning disabilities, as well as other issues practitioners working with children encounter in school settings.

Emphasizing positive ethics, the book models a decision-making process by which practitioners can successfully resolve common ethical challenges. It is organized around the Ethical Standards of the American Psychological Association, each of which is systematically applied to neuropsychology and brought to life through extensive case studies that show the ethical decision-making model in action. (The book contains a total of 27 cases.) The book reflects the most recent published ethical, professional, and legal requirements and guidelines and synthesizes the latest research. Graduate students, those preparing for board certification, and even experienced clinical neuropsychologists will find much here that is useful; it will be especially valuable neuropsychologists who do forensic work. Those who wish to earn CE credit after reading the book are directed to a test on the American Academy of Clinical Neuropsychology website.",

        "description": "Financial management practices are likely to have a marked effect on the financial performance of a corporate enterprise. Therefore, sound financial decisions/practices can contribute towards meeting the desired objective of having profitable operations. This subject assumes paramount significance in view of the present dynamic and turbulent business environment, which has produced more intense competition and smaller profit margins across the world. In this context, the financial management practices of the corporates in India, a country with a vast potential for economic growth, can offer valuable insights. The present study explores whether there has been a major change in the financial performance (measured in terms of profitability) and financial policies/decisions of the sample companies over a fixed period (2000-2001 to 2010-2011), with a special focus on pre and post-recession analysis. It delves deeper into current research areas such as zero working capital, real options in capital budgeting, pecking order in capital structures, and clause 49 as reflected in the financial management decisions of sample companies, and provides a broader perspective by identifying trends (if any) in certain aspects of financial decision-making over the past two decades. A comprehensive study, covering all the major aspects of financial management practices, also contains an inter-sectoral study (among the sample companies) and develops an index of professionalism in financial management based on the practices of the sample companies. The book is primarily targeted at teachers/students of finance, management, commerce, accounting and related professional disciplines/fields. Practitioners/professionals will find it an invaluable text that helps guide them to better decision-making.",

        "description": "What Lemonade Stand Economics will do... Give students a plan to pay for college without needing student loans. Sitting in the financial aid office at freshman orientation is not the time to start planning how you are going to pay for college. The best way to avoid student loan debt is to never sign the loan papers in the first place. In order to do that you need a plan. Lemonade Stand Economics is that plan. Educate students in financial literacy. Financial literacy standards are written right into Lemonade Stand Economics making it useful in the classroom. High schools introduce students to the basics of money management, but Lemonade Stand Economics takes it to another level by teaching students the importance of planning for their financial future, budgeting, setting financial goals and how debt impacts them after graduation. Teach students skills that will benefit them for the rest of their lives regardless of where their career path takes them. Even more important than the money students make working for themselves, is the real world education they receive. Time management, money management, how to market yourself, workplace etiquette, overcoming fear and handling rejection along with the importance of budgeting and the pain of debt. Real issues that are better learned during high school then after college. Paying for college is easier than you think Lemonade Stand Economics teaches high school students how to work for themselves and graduate from college without student loans. Learn to make $15, $20 or even $50 per hour working for yourself and pay for college one semester at a time. It's not hard if you know what to do, but that's the problem. As a high school student you just don't know where to start. Lemonade Stand Economics shows you what you do... and where to start. There is a problem in America - some say an epidemic - called student loan debt. High school students want to attend college but most don't have the money set aside to pay for it. Most take out student loans for four years, graduate, and start off their adult life in debt. Often times starting their adult lives with massive debt. These students are not stupid or lazy, in fact they are quite smart and energetic, but they don't know where to start or what to do to earn enough money to pay for college. They don't need that job slapping sandwiches together for minimum wage and going home smelling like bologna and pickles. That's not going to pay for college! The typical college student graduates with $26,000 in student loans. The typical college graduate takes over 17 years to pay off their student loans. You don't have to be typical! With a good plan you can pay for college without student loans or money from your parents. Lemonade Stand Economics will teach you how to set goals, budget, advertise, market, price jobs, and serve up a steamin' hot plate of fantastic customer service. Once in this money making rhythm you will make enough to pay for college and graduate with no debt. Let your little brother run the lemonade stand now, it's time to make some real money.",

The author angles its book to those who are interested to know what would replace search engines, and how social networks would evolve; what profit can be made of different forms of informational collaboration (crowdsourcing, collaborative filtering). And, the main thing, how it will influence the structure of the society and human pursuit for happiness. The author does not confine himself to a theory, he sets and solves practical questions: How talent, success and \u201cstardom\u201d are interconnected, how to make money in social networks, what is the business model for the development of entertainment and media, how to measure cultural values, and what is the subjective time of the individual and how to make it qualitative? There have been no answers to these questions before. Internet and social networks have provided tools and data that Alexander Dolgin was the first to use in economics.",

        "description": "The idea to publish a Handbook of Economic Psychology came up as a natural consequence of a discussion concerning appropriate reading material for courses in economic psychology. The discussion took place a few years ago in the Department of Economic Psychology at Tilburg University, The Netherlands. It was noted that there was a surprising lack of collections of pertinent readings, to say nothing about the lack of textbooks in the English language. So the present editors, who had been involved in the discussion, decided to start working on a Handbook. The situation has changed quite a lot since then. There are now a number of books, internationally available in the English language, in economic psy chology or behavioral economics. The interest in this field of study is expanding quite impressively. The Journal of Economic Psychology is now (1988) in its ninth volume and many other journals are publishing articles in the field. The application of psychological theories and methods to economic prob lems or the study of economic experiences and behavior is variously referred to as economic psychology or behavioral economics. While in principle we do not want to overdo the differences between the two, we have a feeling that economic psychology has a slightly stronger flavor of psychology than behavioral economics which in its turn seems to be closer to economics. Psychologists tend to feel more at home in economic psychology, while economists seem to favor behavioral economics.",

        "description": "This book covers the main topics that students need to learn in a course on Industrial Organization. It reviews the classic models and important empirical evidence related to the field. However, it will differ from prior textbooks in two ways. First, this book incorporates contributions from behavioral economics and neuroeconomics, providing the reader with a richer understanding of consumer preferences and the motivation for many of the business practices we see today. The book discusses how firms exploit consumers who are prone to making mistakes and who suffer from cognitive dissonance, attention lapses, and bounded rationality, for example and will help explain why firms invest in persuasive advertising, offer 30-day free trials, offer money-back guarantees, and engage in other observed phenomena that cannot be explained by the traditional approaches to industrial organization. A second difference is that this book achieves a balance between textbooks that emphasize formal modeling and those that emphasize the history of the field, empirical evidence, case studies, and policy analysis. This text puts more emphasis on the micro-foundations (i.e., consumer and producer theory), classic game theoretic models, and recent contributions from behavioral economics that are pertinent to industrial organization. Each topic will begin with a discussion of relevant theory and models and will also include a discussion of concrete examples, empirical evidence, and evidence from case studies. This will provide students with a deeper understanding of firm and consumer behavior, of the factors that influence market structure and economic performance, and of policy issues involving imperfectly competitive markets. The book is intended to be a textbook for graduate students, MBAs and upper-level undergraduates and will use examples, graphical analysis, algebra, and simple calculus to explain important ideas and theories in industrial organization.",

        "description": "may be related to another basic assumption in economic psychology: that the human capacity to process information from the environment is limited, and that the kind of optimal use of that information postulated in many economic theories is therefore not possible. The research methods used are mainly geared towards empirical research, and there mostly towards survey research and experimentation. Experimentation involves most often simulated behaviour in a laboratory, which allows the experimental manipulation of possible causes of behaviour which would not be possible in real life. Survey research is the most widely used instrument for investigating real-world behaviour, with all its caveats about establishing causal explanations. Several introductory books (e. g. , Fumham & Lewis, 1986; Lea, Tarpy, & Webley, 1987; van Raaij, van Veldhoven, & Wlimeryd, 1988) and articles (e. g. , van Raaij, 1979; Wiswede, 1988) have appeared recently, which try to give an overview of the field of economic psychology, and which, in varying degrees, demonstrate the three foundations of economic psychology just mentioned. Others have concentrated on certain subtopics, such as the psychology of the labour market (e. g. , Baxter, 1988; Pelzmann, 1986).",

No longer confined by gender, age, ethnicity or income, they are breaking down barriers, shattering stereotypes and redefining the very meaning of consumerism and the marketplace. From traditional to online retailing, from tracking coolhunters to exploring tastepace, The Soul of the New Consumer unearths the very essence of New Consumer's behavior - their drive for authenticity - and goes far beyond the simple concepts of how we shop or what we buy to answer the most important question of all: why. Every facet of the new economy, from buzz marketing and new retailing technologies to internet shopping, has dramatically altered not only how we buy but what we buy and why. In an era of 'cheap is chic', wealthy shoppers haggle to win even the smallest discounts ; gray consumers buy more rap and techno music than anyone else and are the fastest growing group of internet users ; and the Web and the power of micro-marketing have revolutionized forever the means of wooing new customers. New Consumers are taking over the world and redefining the very meaning of consumerism and the marketplace. As likely to be affluent over-fifties as ambitious under-thirties, New Consumers defy traditional marketing concepts and segmentation by age, gender or income. In pursuit of the authentic experience, New Consumers come together in their defining drive for all things 'real', in everything from food to fashion, foreign holidays to furniture, technology to spirituality. Their attention and interest have shifted from commodity to authenticity. In an affluent world now saturated with affordable products there are three new scarcities - time, attention and trust. This major book shows how these can be won by 'giving the soul control' rather than putting customers on the 'customer is king' pedestal. Over the past decade, Lewis and Bridger have been at the forefront of researching the New Consumers - studying their lifestyles, observing behavior and watching the steady rise in their numbers, influence and economic power. Here, for the first time and with example from Starbucks to Dyson, they report the results of their work, including Amex's use of computer technology to create intimate protraits of individuals - what the author's call 'tastepace'.",

        "description": "All individuals who operate in the business sphere, whether as consumers, employers, employees, entrepreneurs, or financial traders to name a few constituents, share a common biological heritage and are defined by a universal human nature. As such, it is surprising that so few business scholars have incorporated biological and evolutionary-informed theories within their conceptual toolboxes. This edited book addresses this lacuna by culling chapters at the intersection of the evolutionary behavioral sciences and specific business contexts including in marketing, consumer behavior, advertising, innovation and creativity, intertemporal choice, negotiations, competition and cooperation in organizational settings, sex differences in workplace patterns, executive leadership, business ethics, store design, behavioral decision making, and electronic communication. To reword the famous aphorism of T. G. Dobzhansky, nothing in business makes sense except in the light of evolution.",

        "description": "\u200bThis dissertation elaborates differences and similarities of forms of ethical behaviour in general and analyses whether German consumers differentiate between different types of ethical behaviour in particular. The thesis is characterised by its intensive combination of theoretical and empirical research. It furthermore contributes to the literature as the method triangulation applied in the different surveys reveals previously unknown relationships between different kinds of ethical behaviour, such as ethical consumption and charitable giving, as well as between different forms of ethical products. Choice experiment, latent class analysis, information display matrix and item-based attitude assessment allowed the comparison of stated and revealed preferences as well as an analysis of the relevance of ethical product features within the context of different product and process attributes. The dissertation provides insights into a research field which is becoming more and more relevant and improves the understanding of consumers\u2019 assessment and the interdependencies of the possibilities of ethical behaviour. This allows the development of recommendations for consumer policy makers, business and NGOs concerned with the ethics of consumer choice as well as future research on ethical behaviour in general and ethical consumption in particular.",

This book identifies behavioural business as a powerful application of the latest insights and tools from psychology and behavioural science to decision-making in business, management and policy. This book uniquely positions behavioural business as different from both behavioural economics and psychology. This book instead applies a fresh focus on behavioural interventions in policy and business. This book introduces this new area and showcases what it contributes to a number of important contemporary business and policy issues. These include behavioural insights for managers in diverse and multi-cultural workplaces, designers of organisations, interventions, products and services, financial advisors, public policy makers, business creatives and entrepreneurs as well as charity and NGO practitioners. This book summarises state-of-the-art knowledge in the areas of expertise of the authors, who are members of the Behavioural Business Lab at RMIT University in Australia. This book will interest advanced students in related subjects as well as academics and policy makers hoping to learn and apply behavioural insights to their areas of expertise.",

In so doing, our dedicated triumvirate has blended together pieces of diverse research traditions-some of them quite puzzling-and mixed significantly differentiated styles of expression. The controversial display of self-confidence by some distinguished colleagues, the amazingly emo tional \"good old\" memories revived by their peers, the scapegoat-finding and moralizing confessions produced by some of their disciples together with the detached systematic rigidity of some others all combine to pro duce a multivarious patchwork that may well prove the existence of a marketing scholar lifecycle. This cartoon-like four-class typology might even make it worth the reader's while to indulge in some guesswork to discover the sequence of the four stages as an exercise and then partition the author population accordingly.",

This multifocal study draws on a wide array of theoretical perspectives, including feminism, posthumanism, masculinity, trauma, spatiality and media studies, and brings together such diverse material as canonical literature, war veterans\u2019 testimonies, imaginative fiction, computer games, English curricula, and Al-Qaeda\u2019s propaganda pieces.

This collection will appeal primarily to academics specialising in English and American literature, but also to those researching media, gender, and game studies.",

These color-coded plans were designed for various political and military events, some of which actually unfolded in the Second World War. Never Wars: The US War Plans to Invade the World explores and provides details on a number of these key military invasion plans, their triggers, units involved, etc. Some of these plans, if executed, would have altered the globe or changed the events of the twentieth century and beyond. Included with this was the 1914 war plan against a triumphant Germany, a 1935 plan to attack Great Britain, the 1920s US plans to land forces in Mexico to topple their government, a plan for invading China and even a 1905 strike into the heart of Canada. From a plan to invade the Azores to an incursion into Cuba, Never Wars presents never before published plans for the US to strike out at the world.",

        "description": "The intent of this book is first, to provide insights into the Vietnam war and second, to express the effects of that war on both the veteran and society. Serving in a war zone necessarily affects the psyche, sometimes producing symptoms of mental illness. It also affects the veteran morally, emotionally and, too often, physically. The stories are meant to elucidate the psychological and other effects that war inflicts. Often, an affected veteran may not realize psychiatric symptoms or their cause. Veterans who read this work will recall their military service and also gain some insight into symptoms that they may have experienced, or continue to experience, as a result of their service. The stories are a mix of fact and fiction. Some stories are based on the author's experience in Vietnam, and on his experience in representing disabled veterans and others with claims for disability benefits. Some stories, or parts of stories, are based on reports of fellow soldiers or on impressions of what likely occurred - - the product of fact and the author's imagination. The poems were written during time served in Vietnam. They reflect thoughts that most GIs had at one time or another. Hopefully, this book will help veterans cope with illnesses and disabilities that were occasioned by their time in the military. It is hoped that society will learn how to relate with courtesy and respect to those who now serve or have served our nation in its various wars.",

        "description": "To fight and conquer in all your battles is not Supreme excellence; Supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy resistance without fighting. The art of War is believed to have been written by the Chinese military strategist, philosopher and writer sun Tzu around 5th century BC. Divided into thirteen chapters, The text is a finely crafted, meticulous guide that deals with military tactics and manoeuvres, which remain relevant and influential even today. Anthologised under seven military classics of ancient China, not only has it shaped East Asian warfare, it has also inspired military experts in the West over the centuries. Despite dealing with military stratagem, the text has also inspired experts in the fields of politics, law, sports and business. As a result, the art of War has been translated into several languages including English, French, Manchu, Assamese and other Asian languages.",

        "description": "The second volume in Siegfried Sassoon\u2019s beloved trilogy, The Complete Memoirs of George Sherston, with a new introduction by celebrated historian Paul Fussell A highly decorated English soldier and an acclaimed poet and novelist, Siegfried Sassoon won fame for his trilogy of fictionalized autobiographies that wonderfully capture the vanishing idylls of Edwardian England and the brutal realities of war. The second volume of Siegfried Sassoon's semiautobiographical George Sherston trilogy picks up shortly after Memoirs of a Fox-hunting Man: in 1916, with the young Sherston deep in the trenches of WWI. For his decorated bravery, and also his harmful recklessness, he is soon sent to the Fourth Army School for officer training, then dispatched to Morlancourt, a raid, and on through the Somme. After being wounded by a bullet through the lung, he returns home to convalesce, where his questioning of the war and the British Military establishment leads him to write a public anti-war letter (verbatim the letter Sassoon wrote in 1917, entitled \"Finished with the War: A Soldier\u2019s Declaration\", which was eventually read in the British House of Commons). Through the help of close friend David Cromlech (based on Sassoon's friend Robert Graves) a medical board decides not to prosecute, but instead deem him to be mentally ill, suffering from shell-shock, and sends him to a hospital for treatment. Sassoon's stunning portrayal of a mind coming to terms with the brutal truths he has encountered in war\u2014as well as his unsentimental, though often poetic, portrayal of class-defined life in England at wartime\u2014is amongst the greatest books ever written about World War I, or war itself.

The strangers are warrior guards from another planet, and the item they\u2019re looking for belonged to their late king, given to the previous owner of the shop, her father, for safekeeping. The only problem is, Lorraine has no idea where the item ended up, and her father\u2019s dead. When she finds out that the item could literally mean life or death for the late king\u2019s followers, under the rule of a new, tyrannical king, she\u2019ll throw herself headlong into helping, and maybe find love along the way.",

        "description": "--Winner \"Cross Genre\" Category 2018 American Fiction Awards-- [Audiobook narrated by Grammy-winning Stefan Rudnicki and award-winning Gabrielle De Cuir.] Part wacky adventure, part political thriller, this unconventional story will keep you guessing. \"One of the most original and creative stories I have read in a very long time.\" --Goodreads reader with over 1,500 ratings! James Wong built a billion-dollar software company with childhood friend Maria Cortez, but a shady investor stole their company. In a video game, James would defeat the villain with a power-up. Maria tells him there aren't power-ups in real life, but James finds the ultimate power-up watching TV in a bar: become president. Making important life decisions in a bar, what could go wrong? Could a non-politician change their name to None of the Above and get elected president? When James and Maria land their own reality TV show, they try to answer that question. They must uncover secrets about their company and themselves, as the world falls apart around them. It will take every ounce of Maria's strength and every crazy idea James can muster to get their company back. Can they survive the chaos of reality TV, the corruption of Washington, and the dark forces aligned against them? Background: When I began writing the book in 2014, I was afraid that many of my ridiculous subplots, like a presidential candidate with his own reality TV show, were too hard to believe. Then Trump ran for president, and the book became more plausible by the day. When events similar to my book began to happen during the 2016 election cycle, it got so weird that I stopped reading the news. When I went back later to research the \"Fact Versus Fiction\" section after the ending, I found even more events similar to the book had happened. What readers are saying: \"prepare for rib-cracking laughter.\" (Online Book Club reader) \"A thriller in every meaning of the word. If you enjoy action books at all, or if you just want some form of fictional closure on the baffling mess that was the 2016 election, I cannot recommend this book highly enough.\" -- Official Review, Online Book Club (4 out of 4 stars rating) \"The story keeps you guessing and in the third act the intrigue and politics give way to a conclusion full of heart-pounding action.\" \"There's a surprise around every corner--be prepared to laugh, cry and for your heart to race.\" \"Thrilling pacing and breakthrough concepts leaves the reader seared in thought.\" \"Amazingly captures the new political landscape that is forming day-by-day. Fans of political thrillers, conspiracy theories, or those looking for a satirical escape from the dreary news that we see every day will certainly enjoy The Internet President: None of the Above\" -- Official Review, Thriller Magazine (5 out of 5 stars rating and a finalist for International Thriller Award)",

But more than anything, it is an encomium to brave souls, past and present, who have shown the will and moral commitment to confront the dark forces that threaten civilized life.",

America has adored rock star Tyler Sloan for decades, and when he decides to leave the Las Vegas stage to run for a seat on the United States Senate, it's assumed that he'll run an unconventional campaign. He exceeds expectations--and more. No stranger to politics, Sloan's estranged father was a California governor who narrowly lost his presidential campaign. It's this experience--and his performance skills--that render a show-stopping performance as an independent candidate for Senate. He expresses disdain for the two-party system and dismisses special interests and lobbyists. Sloan immediately finds himself caught in a political campaign fraught with scandal, corruption, and conflicting loyalties--personally, politically, and romantically. Will Sloan be able to handle political turbulence and reckon with his own past while navigating the polls? As the countdown to election day begins, Tyler Sloan is focused on winning and taking center stage.",

In an attempt to fill this gap, Michelle Shir-Wise examines not only what people do in their free time, but also how they perceive, interpret and experience it, and in what way it relates to notions of happiness, freedom and the ideal self. Time, Freedom and the Self draws on contemporary theoretical debates concerning the relation between discourse, cultural repertoires, subjective meaning and agency, as well as literature around the sociology of leisure, to inform a unique interpretation of free time (\u201cdisciplined freedom\u201d), developed in the light of questionnaires and in-depth interviews with middle-class, middle-aged participants in suburban Israel.",

First, the accounting system is profitably thought of as a library of financial statistics. Answers to a variety of questions are unlikely to be found in prefabricated fonnat, but valuable infonnation awaits those equipped to in the accounting library is most interrogate the library. Second, the infonnation unlikely to be the only infonnation at the manger's disposal. So knowing how to combine accounting and nonaccounting bits of infonnation is an important, indeed indispensable, managerial skill. Finally, the role of a professional manager is emphasized. This is an individual with skill, talent, and imagination, an individual who brings professional quality skills to the ta sk of managing. This book also makes demands on the reader. It assumes the reader has had prior exposure to financial accounting, economics, statistics, and the economics of uncertainty (in the fonn of risk aversion and decision trees). A modest acquaintance with strategic, or equilibrium, modeling is also presumed, as is patience with abstract notation. The hook does not make deep mathematical demands on the reader. An acquaintance with linearprogramming and the ability to take a simple derivative are presumed. The major prerequisite is a tolerance for (if not a predisposition toward) abstract notation. This st yle and list of prerequisites are not matters of taste or author imposition.",

The work offers detail about the effects of China\u2019s economic reforms on management control in Chinese enterprises and insightful comparisons with Western theory and Western examples. Readers will discover important themes and the evolution of theory in MCS, including discussions of frameworks and the links between management control and economics, management, accounting, cybernetics and system theory. Early chapters explore management control in Chinese enterprises during the period, especially the demands of (guidance, enforcement and external regulation) and the demand for (stakeholders, managers, investors) management control. The work moves on to explore Western management control theory and research, including an examination of the evolution of internal control theory. The author presents detailed perspectives on the elements of management control systems and introduces masterful new ideas and methods through four general control models and ten critical elements in the management control process. A view of management control in various different types of enterprise is presented, from special enterprises and small to medium enterprises to non-profit organizations. The standards for enterprise management control are explored. This work is a valuable practical guide for corporate management teams who wish to develop and execute their own internal control strategies. It will also provide foreign researchers, policy-makers and practitioners with a new perspective on Chinese management control experiences.",

        "description": "Financial management practices are likely to have a marked effect on the financial performance of a corporate enterprise. Therefore, sound financial decisions/practices can contribute towards meeting the desired objective of having profitable operations. This subject assumes paramount significance in view of the present dynamic and turbulent business environment, which has produced more intense competition and smaller profit margins across the world. In this context, the financial management practices of the corporates in India, a country with a vast potential for economic growth, can offer valuable insights. The present study explores whether there has been a major change in the financial performance (measured in terms of profitability) and financial policies/decisions of the sample companies over a fixed period (2000-2001 to 2010-2011), with a special focus on pre and post-recession analysis. It delves deeper into current research areas such as zero working capital, real options in capital budgeting, pecking order in capital structures, and clause 49 as reflected in the financial management decisions of sample companies, and provides a broader perspective by identifying trends (if any) in certain aspects of financial decision-making over the past two decades. A comprehensive study, covering all the major aspects of financial management practices, also contains an inter-sectoral study (among the sample companies) and develops an index of professionalism in financial management based on the practices of the sample companies. The book is primarily targeted at teachers/students of finance, management, commerce, accounting and related professional disciplines/fields. Practitioners/professionals will find it an invaluable text that helps guide them to better decision-making.",

        "description": "The purpose of this book is to offer a small token in memory of Ken Hilton, who died prematurely at the age of 52 in February 1990. The book contains contributions from a number of 1eading academics; some were close c- leagues of Ken's at the University of Southampton, some have been at other universities but knew Ken fair1y well, and still some who never met Ken but who knew of him through bis work. The unifying motivation for all of them, however, was their immense sense of loss of an extremely proactive and excellent academic. Having led the research group on the Southampton Econometric Model project for three years, Ken was appointed to the Chair of Financia1 Control at the University of Southampton in 1970; at that time this was one of only a handful of similar Chairs in the UK. Most of Ken's subsequent academic career was devoted to contributing to the study of financial control, initially in the private sector and subsequently in the public sector. The breadth of bis interests was demonstrated by bis enviable ability to contribute to the areas of industrial economics, accounting, and management science. We hope therefore that this volume which embraces contributions from leading academics in each of these three fields is a fitting tribute to Ken's work.",

        "description": "The latest in the successful Oxford Modern Britain series, Kinship and Friendship in Modern Britain provides a succinct introduction to key aspects of kin and friend relationships in Britain today. Graham Allan reviews a cross-section of research to examine the major issues surrounding contemporary kinship and friendship, analyzing the personal - and social - consequence of these ties. The author examines key aspects of interpersonal relations to discuss the nature and importance of kinship in the late twentieth century. After studying modern perspectives on informal relationships, he focuses on kinship solidarities, highlighting their increased complexity in modern Britain, and reviewing the obligations and commitments between different categories of kin. In later chapters, he examines patterns of friendship, concentrating in particular on how they are organized and their social implications. Graham Allan also studies alternative views of kinship and friendship as negotiation and as economic exchange, also analyzing how relationships may change in later life. Kinship and Friendship in Modern Britain provides the student with an invaluable introduction to the fundamental aspects of the sociology of family and friendship in contemporary British life.",

        "description": "In this lively book, Betty Steele argues that feminism has had its day \u2013 that men and women once again are drawing towards one another, seeking new understanding and reconciliation. She writes that men and women today are admitting that they are looking for love and sex that spring from friendship a slow growth of trust, and an affinity of the spirit \u2013 which together can lead to a lifetime commitment. Meanwhile, mothers are realizing that motherhood-on-the-run is a shabby excuse for the real thing, that one hour or so a day of \"quality time\" with their children is not enough and is shortchanging the next generation. Beyond its incisive analysis and documentation, Together Again offers hope that bridges can be built between the sexes towards a happier, healthier society in the 1990s.",

        "description": "This book explores the diverse ways people engage with social media to build, maintain and display personal networks. Despite the remarkable technological possibilities for global networking, most people's online connections are personal, localized or stem from previous local connections. Yet this study also shows how social media are used to generate new modes of self presentation, interaction, and etiquette. Deborah Chambers develops a theory of mediated intimacies to understand how digital communication coincides with new intimacies and meanings of 'friendship' as features of a networked society. The book combines sociological debates about intimacy, family and friendship with media studies of computer mediated communication. How social media transforms personal life is investigated through five broad themes of social media engagement: the presentation of online self; teenage friendships; home, families and new media; digital dating; virtual community and online social capital. The author explains how social media technology contributes to a dramatic reconfiguration of our ideas about intimacy and friendship.",

Most studies have focused on the economic, legal, political, and sociological pr- lems these economies have had to face during the transition period. However, not much has been written about the dramatic changes that have to be made to the accounting and ? nancial system of a transition economy. This book was written to help ? ll that gap. This book is the sixth in a series to examine accounting and ? nancial system reform in transition and developing economies. The ? rst book (Accounting and Financial System Reform in a Transition Economy: A Case Study of Russia) used Russia as a case study. The second volume in the series (Accounting and Financial System Reform in Eastern Europe and Asia) examined some additional aspects of the reform in Russia and also looked at the accounting and ? nancial system reform efforts that are being made in Ukraine, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Armenia, Eastern Europe, and Central Asia. The third volume (Taxation and Public Finance in Tran- tion and Developing Economies) examined taxation and public ? nance in transition and developing economies. The fourth volume (Accounting Reform in Transition and Developing Economies) examines accounting reform in transition and devel- ing economies.",

        "description": "This book is an invitation to study managerial uses of accounting infonnation. Three themes run throughout. First, the accounting system is profitably thought of as a library of financial statistics. Answers to a variety of questions are unlikely to be found in prefabricated fonnat, but valuable infonnation awaits those equipped to in the accounting library is most interrogate the library. Second, the infonnation unlikely to be the only infonnation at the manger's disposal. So knowing how to combine accounting and nonaccounting bits of infonnation is an important, indeed indispensable, managerial skill. Finally, the role of a professional manager is emphasized. This is an individual with skill, talent, and imagination, an individual who brings professional quality skills to the ta sk of managing. This book also makes demands on the reader. It assumes the reader has had prior exposure to financial accounting, economics, statistics, and the economics of uncertainty (in the fonn of risk aversion and decision trees). A modest acquaintance with strategic, or equilibrium, modeling is also presumed, as is patience with abstract notation. The hook does not make deep mathematical demands on the reader. An acquaintance with linearprogramming and the ability to take a simple derivative are presumed. The major prerequisite is a tolerance for (if not a predisposition toward) abstract notation. This st yle and list of prerequisites are not matters of taste or author imposition.",

        "description": "This book brings important new dimensions to the interface between contemporary Western science and ancient Eastern wisdom. Here for the first time the concepts and insights of general systems theory are presented in tandem with those of the Buddha. Remarkable convergences appear between core Buddhist teachings and the systems view of reality, arising in our century from biology and extending into the social and cognitive sciences. Giving a cogent introduction to both bodies of thought, and a fresh interpretation of the Buddha\u2019s core teaching of dependent co-arising, this book shows how their common perspective on causality can inform our lives. The interdependence of all beings provides the context for clarifying both the role of meditative practice and guidelines for effective action on behalf of the common good. Joanna R.

        "description": "The book on The General Theory of Electrical Machines, by B. Adkins, which was published in 1957, has been well received, as a manual containing the theories on which practical methods of calculating machine performance can be based, and as a text-book for advanced students. Since 1957, many important developments have taken place in the practical application of electrical machine theory. The most important single factor in the development has been the increasing availability of the digital computer, which was only beginning to be used in the solution of machine and power system problems in 1957. Since most of the recent development, particularly that with which the authors have been concerned, has related to a. c. machines, the present book, which is in other respects an up-to-date version of the earlier book, deals primarily with a. c. machines. The second chapter on the primitive machine does deal to some extent with the d. c. machine, because the cross-field d. c. generator serves as an introduction to the two-axis theory and can be used to provide a simple explanation of some of the mathematical methods. The equations also apply directly to a. c. commutator machines. The use of the word 'general' in the title has been criticized. It was never intended to imply that the treatment was comprehen sive in the sense that every possible type of machine and problem The word is used in the sense that the theory can was dealt with.",

        "description": "The founder of modern linguistics, Ferdinand de Saussure inaugurated semiology, structuralism, and deconstruction and made possible the work of Jacques Derrida, Roland Barthes, Michel Foucault, and Jacques Lacan, thus enabling the development of French feminism, gender studies, New Historicism, and postcolonialism. Based on Saussure's lectures, Course in General Linguistics (1916) traces the rise and fall of the historical linguistics in which Saussure was trained, the synchronic or structural linguistics with which he replaced it, and the new look of diachronic linguistics that followed this change. Most important, Saussure presents the principles of a new linguistic science that includes the invention of semiology, or the theory of the \"signifier,\" the \"signified,\" and the \"sign\" that they combine to produce. This is the first critical edition of Course in General Linguistics to appear in English and restores Wade Baskin's original translation of 1959, in which the terms \"signifier\" and \"signified\" are introduced into English in this precise way. Baskin renders Saussure clearly and accessibly, allowing readers to experience his shift of the theory of reference from mimesis to performance and his expansion of poetics to include all media, including the life sciences and environmentalism. An introduction situates Saussure within the history of ideas and describes the history of scholarship that made Course in General Linguistics legendary. New endnotes enlarge Saussure's contexts to include literary criticism, cultural studies, and philosophy.",

        "description": "In less than 40 years teratology has grown from a little known discipline concerned with studies on the effects of a few physical and chemical stresses on developing fish, amphibians, and birds, to a discipline embracing a vast accumulation of literature on experimental studies in many animal forms and the results of intensive scrutiny of human development under varied conditions, as well. Emphasis has shifted from preoccupation with descrip tions of anatomical defects to concern about subtle and interacting causative factors, to searches for the early reactions to these at the cellular and subcellu lar levels, and to identification of abnormality in the chemical, the functional, and the ultrastructural realms. These changes in orientation have quite naturally made necessary the recruitment of concepts, methods, and expertise from other disciplines. Hence the foundations of teratology, which once were largely morphological, have extended into genetics, biochemistry, molecular biology, reproductive physiology, epidemiology, and several aspects of veteri nary and clinical medicine. It is not surprising that a student or new investigator approaching the field of teratology may feel some dismay when confronted with the confusing array of cross-disciplinary concepts and principles it encompasses today. One of the aims of this work is to introduce what the editors believe is a logical thread of continuity into a field that may be regarded by some as a welter of disordered information.",

        "description": "This volume consists of a selection of papers presented at the International Conference on Applied General Systems Research: Recent Developments and Trends which was held on the campus of the State University of New York at Binghamton in August 15-19, 1977, under the sponsorship of the Special Panel on Systems Science of the NATO Scientific Affairs Division. General systems research is a fairly new field which has been developing in the course of the last two or three decades. In my op~n10n, it can be best described as a movement which involves the study of all structural and context independent aspects of problem solving. As such, it is cross-disciplinary in nature and, in this sense, it might seem similar to mathematics. There is a consid erable difference, however, between the two. While pure mathe matics is basically oriented to the development of various axiomatic theories, regardless of whether or not they have any real world meaning, applied mathematics explores the applicability of some of these theories as potentially useful methodological tools in various problem areas. General systems research, in contrast with applied mathematics, is problem oriented rather than tool oriented. As such, it tries to develop genuine methods for solving systems problems, i. e. , structural type and context in dependent problems.

        "description": "When you are courting a nice girl an hour seems like a second. When you sit on a red-hot cinder a second seems like an hour. That's relativity.' Dealing with the theory of relativity-- special relativity and general relativity-- and the considerations on the universe as a whole, this book gives an insight into the scientific theory about the relationship between space and time, the theory of gravitation, and the universe. A Nobel laureate, Einstein's research and theories changed the world. First published in 1916, Relativity: The Special and the General Theory is regarded as the most significant work in modern physics. It continues to remain popular and highly influential.\"",

This project is carried out at the crossroads of the history of ideas and political philosophy. It extensively develops historical and philosophical themes, showing modifications to the idea of the general will in the writings of thinkers who sometimes represent very distant epochs. The author tracks down the birth and the development of the idea of the general will in ancient, medieval, modern and contemporary times, devoting most of the book to the thoughts of Jean Jacques Rousseau and nineteenth and twentieth century British idealists.",

        "description": "This book examines the role played by domestic and international judges in the \u201cflexibilization\u201d of legal systems through general principles. It features revised papers that were presented at the Annual Conference of the European-American Consortium for Legal Education, held at the University of Parma, Italy, May 2014. This volume is organized in four sections, where the topic is mainly explored from a comparative perspective, and includes case studies. The first section covers theoretical issues. It offers an analysis of principles in shaping Dworkin\u2019s theories about international law, a reflection on the role of procedural principles in defining the role of the judiciary, a view on the role of general principles in transnational judicial communication, a study on the recognition of international law from formal criteria to substantive principles, and an inquiry from the viewpoint of neo-constitutionalism. The second section contains studies on the role of general principles in selected legal systems, including International Law, European Union Law as well as Common Law systems. The third section features an analysis of select legal principles in a comparative perspective, with a particular focus on the comparison between European and American experiences. The fourth and last section explores selected principles in given areas of law, including the misuse of the lex specialis principle in the relationship between international human rights law and international humanitarian law, the role of the judiciary in Poland as regards discrimination for sexual orientation, and the impact of the ECtHR case law on Italian criminal law with regard to the principle of legality. Overall, the book offers readers a thoughtful reflection on how the interpretation, application, and development of general principles of law by the judiciary contribute to the evolution of legal systems at both the domestic and international levels as well as further their reciprocal interactions.",

Scrambled Hard-Boiled is the story of a young man named Jay Dafoe coming into his own as private detective. Dafoe learns the in and outs of snooping into other people's lives and how to take advantage and profit from it. Philip Marlowe, he ain't.Full of dark humor, the novel is a tale of coming of age in the New South with its class and racial conflicts and the unfortunate habit of killing one another that people have always had in that part of the country. The traditional elements of the hard-boiled murder mystery are here: homicides, adultery, greed, crooked lawyers, mean cops and even meaner broads. Then, just to make things interesting, some regional spices like faith healing, homophobia, rednecks, county fairs and inter-species wrestling have been added to the recipe.",

        "description": "Since the late 1970s, a subgenre of crime fiction, written by women and featuring a professional woman investigator, has exploded on the popular fiction market. Priscilla L. Walton and Manina Jones focus on this recent proliferation of women writers of detective fiction, providing the first book-length study of the historical and societal changes that fueled this popularity, along with insightful and entertaining readings of the texts themselves. Walton and Jones place the genre within its aesthetic, social, and economic contexts, reading it as an index of cultural beliefs. Addressing the ways that Sara Paretsky, Sue Grafton, Marcia Muller, and others work through the conventions of the \"hard-boiled\" genre made popular by writers such as Dashiell Hammett, Raymond Chandler, and Mickey Spillane, the authors show how the male hard-boiled tradition has been challenged and transformed. Issues of child, spousal, and sexual abuse are more likely to surface in women's detective novels, the authors show, and female sleuths face many of the same dilemmas as those who read about them\u2014everyday problems with relationships, parenting, and money. Detective Agency also integrates interviews with authors and publishers, reader surveys, publication data, and analysis of internet discussion groups to present a fascinating picture of the \"industry\" of women's detective fiction. Authors of these works are powerful players in the publishing system as well as agents of cultural intervention, Walton and Jones claim. They conclude by examining the rise of female detectives in television and film.",

He comes to Guatemala, the deadliest nation in the Americas, to kidnap a Sinaloan cartel member and turn him against his family.

First, a number of key papers provide an insight into global business, wealth creation and welfare issues with particular reference to the African continent - appropriate for a Congress that was based in South Africa and drew wide participation from African scholars. Second, it provides the output from a global research project on \"Fairness in International Trade\" which ran over the two years prior to the Congress. This project drew together the work of scholars in five regions across the globe and is the first time that such a global perspective has been attempted. This book is aimed at academics working in the area of international trade or development economics particularly those who have an interest in the ethical dimensions of trade. It will also be of interest to students of development economics and business ethics particularly at Masters and Doctoral level.",

        "description": "\u200bThis dissertation elaborates differences and similarities of forms of ethical behaviour in general and analyses whether German consumers differentiate between different types of ethical behaviour in particular. The thesis is characterised by its intensive combination of theoretical and empirical research. It furthermore contributes to the literature as the method triangulation applied in the different surveys reveals previously unknown relationships between different kinds of ethical behaviour, such as ethical consumption and charitable giving, as well as between different forms of ethical products. Choice experiment, latent class analysis, information display matrix and item-based attitude assessment allowed the comparison of stated and revealed preferences as well as an analysis of the relevance of ethical product features within the context of different product and process attributes. The dissertation provides insights into a research field which is becoming more and more relevant and improves the understanding of consumers\u2019 assessment and the interdependencies of the possibilities of ethical behaviour. This allows the development of recommendations for consumer policy makers, business and NGOs concerned with the ethics of consumer choice as well as future research on ethical behaviour in general and ethical consumption in particular.",

        "description": "Real estate market research and analysis often draws on theory and techniques borrowed from other disciplines; in particular economics, finance and geography. Few textbooks recognise this, which makes Real Estate Market Research and Analysis a unique and innovative read. This accessible text provides a general overview of research philosophy and research practise in the real estate economics discipline. A range of applied quantitative empirical methods, commonly used in both academic and applied real estate market research and analysis, are examined as well as selected research-based studies which demonstrate how these methods are applied. Recent trends and developments in the evolving real estate economics research agenda are also explored. This book is aimed at both undergraduate students and practitioners in the commercial property and real estate sector. It is essential reading for modules on general practice surveying. It sets out the means and methods by which a commercial property rent model should be constructed and estimated, and provides a helpful guide to good property market research practise. Key features include; a Foreword by Dr Craig Watkins at the University of Aberdeen, and a Glossary of property and economic research terms.",

The introduction argues that though there may be perceived disadvantages in investing in Vietnam, there are a number of benefits as well, such as the country's openness to trade and foreign direct investment, the increasing ease of doing business there and the dynamism of the economy. The book then provides an overview of Vietnam's economic policy since 1975, covering reunification, attempts at a command economy, and finally renovation under Doi Moi Policy. Further chapters cover the expansion of the private sector, interest in foreign investment, and the peculiarities of marketing and finance in Vietnam. As an edited volume with chapters written by Vietnamese scholars across economics, history, and business, this book is critical reading for researchers studying Vietnam and other Asian economies and for businesses interested in expanding into that market.",

        "description": "This book presents an empirical investigation of the efforts that multinational pharmaceutical companies take in order to find a business model that allows for a profitable access to the Bottom of the Pyramid (BoP) markets. The Bottom of the Pyramid in Africa is frequently mentioned as an attractive market due to its sheer size. Yet most companies struggle to access it because of the low price level, difficult physical market access and challenges when it comes to payment. More specifically, the book investigates the following business model-related questions: Do pharmaceutical companies provide products that meet the needs of the BoP? What characterizes the value generation of the company? What revenue model leads to a profitable business, and what role does a network of partners play in the business model? Findings reveal that there is no \u2018one-size-fits-all\u2019 answer to these questions. Providing continuous availability, affordability at a good quality of goods and services, creating health awareness, as well as localizing business to achieve a level of inclusiveness are essential prerequisites for success. In the last chapter this book provides a business model prototype that accounts for these key success factors for business at the Bottom of the Pyramid and points to further research topics.",

Governments are reviewing the rules of usage for consumer data in marketing and advertising in order to take advantage of the huge economic opportunity that the data driven economy represents. Companies, recognizing the opportunity, are hurrying to adapt by digitalizing their processes. They are putting pressure on their managers and working teams to learn how to make best use of the technology capabilities and their data resources. What is more, premier national companies have to compete in a global business field where their Silicon Valley-breed competitors have a substantial advantage in terms of digitalization and data usage. Written in plain English with illustrative examples and cases, this book is for the general manager who seeks a better grasp of this fast-changing business world and a better understanding of what will be required from he/she, not just now but in five years' time.",

        "description": "The Digital Hand, Volume 2, is a historical survey of how computers and telecommunications have been deployed in over a dozen industries in the financial, telecommunications, media and entertainment sectors over the past half century. It is past of a sweeping three-volume description of how management in some forty industries embraced the computer and changed the American economy. Computers have fundamentally changed the nature of work in America. However it is difficult to grasp the full extent of these changes and their implications for the future of business. To begin the long process of understanding the effects of computing in American business, we need to know the history of how computers were first used, by whom and why. In this, the second volume of The Digital Hand, James W. Cortada combines detailed analysis with narrative history to provide a broad overview of computing's and telecomunications' role in over a dozen industries, ranging from Old Economy sectors like finance and publishing to New Economy sectors like digital photography and video games. He also devotes considerable attention to the rapidly changing media and entertainment industries which are now some of the most technologically advanced in the American economy. Beginning in 1950, when commercial applications of digital technology began to appear, Cortada examines the ways different industries adopted new technologies, as well as the ways their innovative applications influenced other industries and the US economy as a whole. He builds on the surveys presented in the first volume of the series, which examined sixteen manufacturing, process, transportation, wholesale and retail industries. In addition to this account, of computers' impact on industries, Cortada also demonstrates how industries themselves influenced the nature of digital technology. Managers, historians and others interested in the history of modern business will appreciate this historical analysis of digital technology's many roles and future possibilities in an wide array of industries. The Digital Hand provides a detailed picture of what the infrastructure of the Information Age really looks like and how we got there.",

We learned to live with \"hardware\" and \"software. \" We were less enthusiastic about \"Iiveware. \" Polite and some impolite questioning revealed that \"Iiveware\" was a euphemism for \"people. \" We were not amused. As one spirited participant observed, \"I refused to go home and tell my children that Almighty God had made liveware in His own image and likeness. \" People are too important to be known as anything but people. Moreover, it is the importance of people that is the dominating and recurring theme of this book by Christopher Baldry. He deals with virtually every aspect of the problems concerning men and women and their recourse to the equipment. This could well become the definitive work in the field. In addition to the details of health hazards, industrial relations, new technology agreements and the like, Dr. Baldry grapples with two great underpinning issues.",

        "description": "An adrenaline-filled war story that depicts the challenges of military special operations in a dangerous, boulder-filled landscape The Company has a special secret operation planned for one of their top agents: the leaders of the Taliban and al-Qaeda terrorist groups are hiding out in Pashtun country, and they must be eliminated. The job falls to a man they have named Frank Morgan\u2014an agent who stood out as a recruit at Quantico and whose skills resemble those of the legendary Vietnam assassin. The other soldiers claim Frank\u2019s abilities as a sniper and a tracker border on the supernatural and are more than willing to complete this mission with him. Frank begins his adventure in Afghanistan with another Company-appointed soldier: an indestructible lyrical Irishman with a cutting sense of humor and a bottle of Jameson never far from hand. After the men rescue a burqa-clad young woman, they soon discover that the Company has not been honest with them and decide to take a second mate under their wing\u2014a giant who quotes poetry and rap songs while he both enacts torture and lives through his own agonizing trials. They know now that oil, drugs, and greed have led to this quest; assassinating the terrorists is not their main objective. However, this still must be done. After becoming dangerously acquainted with the heroin business in the frontier provinces, Frank and his comrades continue their mission. But the lines have now blurred, and the assignment is more complicated than they expected.

        "description": "A military hero? Or a traitor to his comrades and his country? A gripping thriller full of suspense and intrigue, from master author Max Hennessy. When, in 1939, a letter cast doubts on the military reputation of a man likely to become Commander-in-Chief of the British Expeditionary Force if war with Germany should be declared, he had no alternative but to bring the matter to court. The case took the judge, the jury and a fascinated public back to a day in the winter of 1919 when British troops, in action against Bolshevik forces in South Russia, made the last charge of British horsed cavalry. Their commander was Lieutenant General Henry Prideaux: for this, \u2018the Balaclava of the Russian Civil War\u2019, he won the D.S.O. and made his name. But justifiably? \u2018The truth,\u2019 one of his subordinates in the action had written, 'is that before \u2013 and after \u2013 the action at Dankoi, when it came to leading and giving orders, Colonel Prideaux was noticeably not among those present.\u2019 A scintillating story of deceit, conflict and the final days of British cavalry might, this is Max Hennessy at his very best, perfect for fans of Alistair MacLean, John Grisham and A Few Good Men.",

        "description": "From their inception, video games quickly became a major new arena of popular entertainment. Beginning with very primitive games, they quickly evolved into interactive animated works, many of which now approach film in terms of their visual excitement. But there are important differences, as Arthur Asa Berger makes clear in this important new work. Films are purely to be viewed, but video involves the player, moving from empathy to immersion, from being spectators to being actively involved in texts. Berger, a renowned scholar of popular culture, explores the cultural significance of the expanding popularity and sophistication of video games and considers the biological and psychoanalytic aspects of this phenomenon. Berger begins by tracing the evolution of video games from simple games like Pong to new, powerfully involving and complex ones like Myst and Half-Life. He notes how this evolution has built the video industry, which includes the hardware (game-playing consoles) and the software (the games themselves), to revenues comparable to the American film industry. Building on this comparison, Berger focuses on action-adventure games which, like film and fiction, tell stories but which also involve culturally important departures in the conventions of narrative. After defining a set of bipolar oppositions between print and electronic narratives, Berger considers the question of whether video games are truly interactive or only superficially so, and whether they have the potential to replace print narratives in the culture at large. A unique dimension of the book is its bio-psycho-social analysis of the video game phenomenon. Berger considers the impact of these games on their players, from physical changes (everything from neurological problems to obesity) to psychological consequences, with reference to violence and sexual attitudes. He takes these questions further by examining three enormously popular games-Myst/Riven, Tomb Raider, and Half-Life-for their attitudes toward power, gender, violence, and guilt. In his conclusion, Berger concentrates on the role of violence in video games and whether they generate a sense of alienation in certain addicted players who become estranged from family and friends. Accessibly written and broad-ranging in approach, Video Games offers a way to interpret a major popular phenomenon. Arthur Asa Berger is professor of broadcast and electronic communication arts at San Francisco State University, where he has taught since 1965. He is the author of more than one hundred articles and forty books on media, popular culture, humor, and everyday life.",

        "description": "'This collection of legal, philosophical, economic, and cultural perspectives ultimately makes a strong case for the potential value of game environments for addressing diversity issues, but also raises important concerns regarding implementation of corporate and government policies in this sector highly recommended for anyone exploring this emerging field.' Benjamin T. Duranske, Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP, US 'Videogaming is serious business. But the legal and theoretical implications of online and virtual environments are little understood. Professor Graber and Ms. Burri-Nenova have done a masterful job of bringing together several insightful articles that inform us about the business, legal and sociological implications of digital gaming. Innovative, fast-paced, and engaging as games themselves, these scholarly works provide invaluable insight for academics, policy makers and perhaps even participants themselves about the reality behind virtual worlds.' Shubha Ghosh, University of Wisconsin Law School, US 'This is an excellent and path-breaking collection of sharp and carefully researched essays. It provides wonderful insights on numerous important aspects of the complex relationship between play, cultural diversity, communications policy, and the governance of virtual societies. The phenomenal growth of these new digital realms has raised important questions across the academic disciplines, making this book's interdisciplinary focus extremely helpful to potential regulators and university scholars alike.' Greg Lastowka, Rutgers School of law, Camden, US This innovative book provides transdisciplinary analyses of the nature and dynamics of digital game environments whilst tackling the existing fragmentation of academic research. Digital game environments are of increasing economic, social and cultural value. As their influence on diverse facets of life grows, states have felt compelled to intervene and secure some public interests. Yet, the contours of a comprehensive governance model are far from recognisable and governments are grappling with the complexity and fluidity of online games and virtual worlds as private spaces and as experimentation fields for creativity and innovation. This book contributes to a more comprehensive and fine-grained understanding of digital game environments, which is a precondition for addressing any of the pressing governance questions posed. Particular attention is given to the concept and policy objective of cultural diversity, which also offers a unique entry point into the discussion of the appropriate legal regulation of digital games. Governance of Digital Game Environments and Cultural Diversity will be of interest to researchers of media law, internet law and governance, cultural studies, anthropology and sociology. As the book addresses a highly topical theme, it will attract the attention of policymakers at national, regional and international levels and will also serve as a great resource tool for scholars in new media and in particular digital games and virtual worlds.",

Contributors, primarily from rhetoric and writing studies, connect instances of ethos and ethical practice with writing pedagogy, game studies, video games, gaming communities, gameworlds, and the gaming industry. The collection\u2019s eighteen chapters investigate game-based writing classrooms, gamification, game design, player agency, and writing and gaming scholarship in order to illuminate how ethos is reputed, interpreted, and remembered in virtual gamespaces and in the gaming industry. Ethos is constructed, invented, and created in and for games, but inevitably spills out into other domains, affecting agency, ideology, and the cultures that surround game developers, players, and scholars.",

        "description": "From their inception, video games quickly became a major new arena of popular entertainment. Beginning with very primitive games, they quickly evolved into interactive animated works, many of which now approach film in terms of their visual excitement. But there are important differences, as Arthur Asa Berger makes clear in this important new work. Films are purely to be viewed, but video involves the player, moving from empathy to immersion, from being spectators to being actively involved in texts. Berger, a renowned scholar of popular culture, explores the cultural significance of the expanding popularity and sophistication of video games and considers the biological and psychoanalytic aspects of this phenomenon. Berger begins by tracing the evolution of video games from simple games like Pong to new, powerfully involving and complex ones like Myst and Half-Life. He notes how this evolution has built the video industry, which includes the hardware (game-playing consoles) and the software (the games themselves), to revenues comparable to the American film industry. Building on this comparison, Berger focuses on action-adventure games which, like film and fiction, tell stories but which also involve culturally important departures in the conventions of narrative. After defining a set of bipolar oppositions between print and electronic narratives, Berger considers the question of whether video games are truly interactive or only superficially so, and whether they have the potential to replace print narratives in the culture at large. A unique dimension of the book is its bio-psycho-social analysis of the video game phenomenon. Berger considers the impact of these games on their players, from physical changes (everything from neurological problems to obesity) to psychological consequences, with reference to violence and sexual attitudes. He takes these questions further by examining three enormously popular games-Myst/Riven, Tomb Raider, and Half-Life-for their attitudes toward power, gender, violence, and guilt. In his conclusion, Berger concentrates on the role of violence in video games and whether they generate a sense of alienation in certain addicted players who become estranged from family and friends. Accessibly written and broad-ranging in approach, Video Games offers a way to interpret a major popular phenomenon. Arthur Asa Berger is professor of broadcast and electronic communication arts at San Francisco State University, where he has taught since 1965. He is the author of more than one hundred articles and forty books on media, popular culture, humor, and everyday life.",

        "description": "This book provides an in-depth, feminist and sociological analysis of Gamergate, a major social movement and anti-feminist harassment campaign. Gamergate provides a clear example of both how a modern anti-feminist \u2018backlash\u2019 is enacted, and how feminists in the digital age respond. Chapters connect Gamergate to the broader Men\u2019s Rights Activism (MRA) political movement, examining men\u2019s anxieties surrounding what they see as an erosion of male privilege, their conflation of privilege with rights, as well as their use of social media to harass and attack women as a response to their perceived oppression. Likewise, the author analyses the online strategies used by feminists to respond to this backlash, how social media is harnessed to build a feminist movement, the effectiveness of these online strategies, and the parallels that these actions have with those from previous waves of feminism. Finally, the author reflects on what has changed with regards to MRA, online harassment, and digital feminism after the height of Gamergate. This book will be of interest to scholars in Gender Studies, Sociology, and Media Studies.",

It demontrates that the scope of economics is widened by the inclusion of the cultural and ethical determinants of economic action and by bringing the ethical and cultural factors back into economics and management science. The book's contribution to business ethics and economic ethics lies in its distinctly continental European background which is often overlooked in current discussions of economic theory. The papers in this volume point to a mutual interpenetration of economics and ethics in a new synthesis of \"ethical economy\".",

Calculation develops due to a demand for control and accountability. Money is one such instrument of calculation, and the foremost. As a unit of account and means of payment, it serves the purpose of exchange. Yet, money has itself increasingly become an object of calculation and exchange on financial markets tending less to the production and exchange of real goods than the elimination of uncertainty by means of exchangeability. Has the economy therefore lost its measure? The essays collected in Money and Calculation investigate, from various viewpoints, how calculation and money bear upon the meaning of measure in contemporary economic life. They will excite and give much pause for thought to economists, sociologists, and all who have an interest in the meaning of life in our globalized world.",

        "description": "This book is a welcome reassertion of an old tradition of interdisdplinary research. That tradition has tended to atrophy in the last decade, largely because of an enormous expansion of the domain of neoc1assical economics. The expansion has fed on two sdentific developments: first, human capital theory; second, contract theory. Both developments have taken phenomena critical to the operation of the economy but previously understood in terms of categories separate and distinct from those with which economists generally work and sought to apply the same analytical techniques that we use to understand other economic problems. Human capital theory has applied conventional techniques to questions of labor supply. It began this endeavor with the supply of trained labor and then expanded to a general theory of labor supply by broadening the analysis to the allocation of time over the individual's life, the interdependendes of supply decisions within the family, and finally to the formation of the family itself. Similarly, contract theory has moved from a theory that explains the existence of c10sed economic institutions to a theory of their formation and internaioperation. The hallmark of both of these developments is the extension and applica tion of analytical techniques based on purposive maximization under con traints and the interaction of individual decision makers through a com petitive market or its analogue.",

        "description": "This book shares the learnings and perspectives of two pioneer women who waded the many challenges posed by multiculturalism and gender in one of the corporate environments more rigid and traditional in the business world: the energy sector in the Middle East. How they managed to create a growth space for themselves and their teams is a story of professional and personal tenacity, shaping a privileged perspective that enabled them to understand the root causes of barriers, as well as envision plausible solutions. They propose in the book not only their vision, but a remarkable collection of unfiltered interviews to influential leaders in the energy sector, to complete a vision of what is key to achieve success when leading or consulting in a corporate environment. The book offers a compilation of very personal approaches to professionalism, resilience, work, and ultimately, success, from within and outside the ranks of highly regarded corporations in the energy sector. The ultimate aim is that of triggering a self-reflection in the readers, grounded on the learnings and perspectives of those who made it to the highest roles of one of the less understood business environments.",

The book is divided into four sections. The first section `Learning Objectives and Programme Structures' addresses the theme of the book. It examines how to ensure that the objectives and structures employed are appropriate in the modern environment. The second section `The Structure of the Learning Environment' is a continuation of the first section but focuses on how the learning environment is designed to facilitate the student's learning. The third section `Information Technology in the Learning Environment' contains two articles examining the use of Information Technology as a learning tool. The final section `Evaluating Student Skills' deals with the important issue of developing the student's skills and how they can be evaluated. This volume addresses issues faced by teachers in higher and further education, but also those involved in programmes of study for continuing professional development.",

        "description": "Economic theory is growing not only in depth but in the breadth of its application as well. This study encroaches in part on a field normally considered as the domain of Sociology. But the methods applied here are those of mathematical economics. It has not been my ambition to make this as general and as mathe matically demanding as possible. On the contrary, I wanted to present as simple an argument as possible throughout. I wish to thank Brown University for granting me a Sabbatical leave in the Fall of 1977-78 in the course of which I wrote the first draft of this monograph. I am also grateful to the late Professor Jacob Marschak and to Professor Arthur Geoffrion for sponsoring me as a Visiting Scholar of the Western Management Science Institute, Graduate School of Management, UCLA for the months of November and December 1977. The Western Management Science Institute proved to be an ideal environment for writing: protective and stimulating at the same time. I have benefitted specifically from comments received as a result of presenting Chapters IV and V in the Marschak Colloquium on December 2, 1977, in particular by Professors Intri11igator and Spiro. My greatest indebtedness is to Jacob Marschak to whom I owe my awareness of and interest in the economic theory of organizations. He was my teacher, my director and supervisor, and my fatherly friend since 1950. It is thus entirely fitting that this work should be dedicated to his memory.",

        "description": "Business Journalism: How to Report on Business and Economics is a basic guide for journalists working in countries moving to open-market economies, students in journalism courses, journalists changing direction from general news reporting to business and economic reporting, and bloggers. It also explains the differences in technique required for general reporters to deliver business news for text, TV, or radio. Veteran journalist Keith Hayes, who has worked for such organizations as Reuters, PBS, the BBC, CBC, and CNBC, provides a quick reference to journalistic practice that covers everything from how to meet a deadline to getting answers from company or government officials who would rather not talk. It also provides background on specific knowledge that journalists should have to report on the business and the economy accurately and with insight. That includes understanding the major markets and how they work, learning to read a balance sheet, and getting the story even when a company or government sets up roadblocks. As Hayes demonstrates, effective journalists are story tellers who need to tell the story well while making certain they are providing the facts as they find them and understand them. Among other things, readers will also learn: How to write a business news story How to report business news on television How to report in a globalized business world How to get usable information from press conferences and briefings The basics of macroeconomics, the financial markets, and company-specific financial data How to dig for facts and get the story This book covers comprehensively the basics of business and economic reporting. With its insights and tips from Hayes and other veteran journalists, it\u2019s a book that will remain on your shelf for years to come and help you acquire and cement career-enhancing skills. It will also help you hone your craft as you begin to write more sophisticated stories and take jobs of increasing responsibility.",

        "description": "The Digital Hand, Volume 2, is a historical survey of how computers and telecommunications have been deployed in over a dozen industries in the financial, telecommunications, media and entertainment sectors over the past half century. It is past of a sweeping three-volume description of how management in some forty industries embraced the computer and changed the American economy. Computers have fundamentally changed the nature of work in America. However it is difficult to grasp the full extent of these changes and their implications for the future of business. To begin the long process of understanding the effects of computing in American business, we need to know the history of how computers were first used, by whom and why. In this, the second volume of The Digital Hand, James W. Cortada combines detailed analysis with narrative history to provide a broad overview of computing's and telecomunications' role in over a dozen industries, ranging from Old Economy sectors like finance and publishing to New Economy sectors like digital photography and video games. He also devotes considerable attention to the rapidly changing media and entertainment industries which are now some of the most technologically advanced in the American economy. Beginning in 1950, when commercial applications of digital technology began to appear, Cortada examines the ways different industries adopted new technologies, as well as the ways their innovative applications influenced other industries and the US economy as a whole. He builds on the surveys presented in the first volume of the series, which examined sixteen manufacturing, process, transportation, wholesale and retail industries. In addition to this account, of computers' impact on industries, Cortada also demonstrates how industries themselves influenced the nature of digital technology. Managers, historians and others interested in the history of modern business will appreciate this historical analysis of digital technology's many roles and future possibilities in an wide array of industries. The Digital Hand provides a detailed picture of what the infrastructure of the Information Age really looks like and how we got there.",

        "description": "The book describes the main directions for the development of the digital society. The author angles its book to those who are interested to know what would replace search engines, and how social networks would evolve; what profit can be made of different forms of informational collaboration (crowdsourcing, collaborative filtering). And, the main thing, how it will influence the structure of the society and human pursuit for happiness. The author does not confine himself to a theory, he sets and solves practical questions: How talent, success and \u201cstardom\u201d are interconnected, how to make money in social networks, what is the business model for the development of entertainment and media, how to measure cultural values, and what is the subjective time of the individual and how to make it qualitative? There have been no answers to these questions before. Internet and social networks have provided tools and data that Alexander Dolgin was the first to use in economics.",

        "description": "This book presents an analysis of how the economic Korean Miracle spread into the cultural \u201cKorean Wave\u201d (Hallyu). First only in Asian countries and then around the world, the rising popularity of the Korean Wave continued within the pandemic\u2014despite or even because of policies of digital lockdowns. Partially, this has been by design as Korea for decades has had a very strong fast development drive in telecommunications and that aided the growth of its cultural wave. Partially however, this became exclusively by default how the Korean Wave had to spread increasingly in a digital manner after 2020 globally, in response to many countries\u2019 rules regarding the COVID-19 pandemic in their attempts to enforce a decline in face-to-face content consumption. In retrospect, this has meant only more digital growth and innovation for the Korean Wave in past years compared to other cultures' entertainment complexes that suffered more. Korea's earlier digital readiness combined with later lockdown conditions and pushed the Korean Wave further ahead. Despite the ending of COVID-19 lockdowns in many countries, a greater digital aftermath will continue in the cultural industry and in the economy in general. This is due to changes created in cultural preferences, in organizational investments, and in communication technologies due to those lockdowns. Thus, the authors examine how the Korean Wave coped actively with a pronounced digital shift by default in all aspects of media including production, distribution, and consumption. In turn, they examine how the greater digital shift in the world\u2019s culture and economy influenced the Korean Wave\u2019s entertainment performances, TV dramas, and cosmetics\u2014among other areas. The authors analyze general trends in the Korean Wave\u2019s economics, culture, and technology along with specific strong cases of the K-pop boy group BTS, the cosmetics manufacturer Cosmax, and the television series Squid Game. Since the Korean Wave continues to grow in popularity within a more exclusive digital socialization, future implications of such a competitive digital world economy and multi-polar digital world culture are discussed for all countries as well.",

        "description": "This book offers a radical new theory of the role of poetry in the rise of cultural nationalism. With equal attention to England, Scotland, and Wales, the book takes an Archipelagic approach to the study of poetics, print media, and medievalism in the rise of British Romanticism. It tells the story of how poets and antiquarian editors in the British nations rediscovered forgotten archaic poetic texts and repurposed them as the foundation of a new concept of the nation, now imagined as a primarily cultural formation. It also draws on legal and ecclesiastical history in drawing a sharp contrast between early modern and Romantic antiquarianisms. Equally a work of literary criticism and history, the book offers provocative new theorizations of nationalism and Romanticism and new readings of major British poets, including Allan Ramsay, Thomas Gray, and Samuel Taylor Coleridge.",

        "description": "Modernism is typically associated with novelty and urbanity. So what happens when poets identify small communities and local languages with the spirit of transnational modernity? Are vernacular poetries inherently provincial or implicitly xenophobic? How did modernist poets use vernacular language to re-imagine the relations between people, their languages, and the communities in which they live? Nations of Nothing But Poetry answers these questions through case studies of British, Caribbean, and American poetries from the 1920s through the 1990s. With a combination of fresh insights and attentive close readings, Matthew Hart presents a new theory of a \"synthetic vernacular\"-writing that explores the aesthetic and ideological tensions within modernism's dual commitments to the local and the global. The result is an invigorating contribution to the field of transnational modernist studies. Chapters focus on a mixture of canonical and non-canonical writers, combining new literary histories--such as the story of how Melvin B. Tolson, while a resident of Oklahoma, was appointed Poet Laureate of Liberia--with analyses of poems by Gertrude Stein, W. H. Auden, Ezra Pound, and T. S. Eliot. More broadly, the book reveals how the language of modernist poetry was shaped by the incompletely globalized nature of a world in which the nation-state continued to be a primary mediator of cultural and political identity, even as its authority was challenged as never before. Through deft juxtaposition, Hart develops a new interpretation of modernist poetry in English-one that disrupts the critical opposition between nationalism and the transnational, paving the way for a political history of modernist cosmopolitanism.",

His mock-heroic satirical poem on the political chaos surrounding the most important UK decision since the Second World War is in rhymed heroic couplets, in the tradition of Dryden and Pope. In this sequel, Fools\u2019 Gold, Hagger focuses on the beginning of Boris Johnson\u2019s premiership, the promises that won him the 2019 General Election with an 80-seat majority, and his removal of the UK from the EU, only to be engulfed by the deadly Covid pandemic which has devastated the UK economy. Hagger describes the catastrophic national events in heroic blank verse, which befits the darkening mood. The UK public has been promised a new Golden Age, an age of plenty, and it remains to be seen whether there will be prosperity for all - gold - now that the UK is facing colossal debt outside the EU, or whether the promises will turn out to be worthless iron pyrites: fools\u2019 gold.",

This collection of new essays offers the first sustained comparison of modern Irish and Scottish poetry, featuring close readings of texts within broad historical and political contextualisation. Playing on influences, crossovers, connections, disconnections and differences, the 'affinities' and 'opposites' traced in this book cross both Irish and Scottish poetry in many directions. Contributors include major scholars of the new 'archipelagic' approach, as well as leading Irish and Scottish poets providing important insights into current creative practice. Poets discussed include W. B. Yeats, Hugh MacDiarmid, Sorley MacLean, Louis MacNeice, Edwin Morgan, Douglas Dunn, Seamus Heaney, Ian Hamilton Finlay, Michael Longley, Medbh McGuckian, Nuala ni Dhomhnaill, Don Paterson and Kathleen Jamie. This book is a major contribution to our understanding of poetry from these islands in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.",

        "description": "Regional voices from England, Ireland, and Scotland inspired Seamus Heaney, the 1995 Nobel prize-winner, to become a poet, and his home region of Northern Ireland provided the subject matter for much of his poetry. In his work, Heaney explored, recorded, and preserved both the disappearing agrarian life of his origins and the dramatic rise of sectarianism and the subsequent outbreak of the Northern Irish \u201cTroubles\u201d beginning in the late 1960s. At the same time, Heaney consistently imagined a new region of Northern Ireland where the conflicts that have long beset it and, by extension, the relationship between Ireland and the United Kingdom might be synthesized and resolved. Finally, there is a third region Heaney committed himself to explore and map\u2014the spirit region, that world beyond our ken. In Seamus Heaney\u2019s Regions, Richard Rankin Russell argues that Heaney\u2019s regions\u2014the first, geographic, historical, political, cultural, linguistic; the second, a future where peace, even reconciliation, might one day flourish; the third, the life beyond this one\u2014offer the best entrance into and a unified understanding of Heaney\u2019s body of work in poetry, prose, translations, and drama. As Russell shows, Heaney believed in the power of ideas\u2014and the texts representing them\u2014to begin resolving historical divisions. For Russell, Heaney\u2019s regionalist poetry contains a \u201cHegelian synthesis\u201d view of history that imagines potential resolutions to the conflicts that have plagued Ireland and Northern Ireland for centuries. Drawing on extensive archival and primary material by the poet, Seamus Heaney\u2019s Regions examines Heaney\u2019s work from before his first published poetry volume, Death of a Naturalist in 1966, to his most recent volume, the elegiac Human Chain in 2010, to provide the most comprehensive treatment of the poet\u2019s work to date.",

Directed at future general managers and international executives, rather than HR specialists, it is designed to help students as well as professionals recognize the critical human resource issues underlying the cultural and economic challenges they face. The book will enhance their skills in making effective HR decisions to cope with business challenges and opportunities.The book's approach is truly global in nature, not just focused on expatriates from the home country. The authors also recognize contemporary trends in the global business arena, including the growing use of contingent workers, strategic alliances, and offshore outsourcing arrangements, and the need to have an active influence on (if not manage directly) the workforce in these new organizational relationships.The text's practical, real-world emphasis is enhanced by student friendly tools in each chapter, including an opening case scenario to attract interest and emphasize topic importance; two additional end-of-chapter short cases to promote class discussion; Global Workforce Challenge vignettes; a profile of an international professional working in each chapter topic area; and recommended online resources for further reference and details.",

        "description": "Due to escalating pressures from domestic and global competitors, and changes in so cietal norms, laws, and the economy during the past decade, it has become clear to many executives that people are increasingly important to the success and survival of their companies, but also increasingly more complex to manage. Moreover, it is likely that the complexity will increase even further in the Nineties as global and regional econ omies continue to emerge. In Europe, entirely new political entities will contribute to complexity and pose difficult problems in a multi-ethnic society. While creating many challenges, these pressures are also creating excellent opportunities for human resource (HR) executives to make substantial contributions to their organiza tions. Whether such opportunities are realized, however, will depend upon how well these executives develop, refme, and leverage both their business and human resource management skills. This book, which is a collaborative effort on the part of the editors of the Human Re source Planning journal and Gabler Publishing, is intended for both line and HR ex ecutives interested in more effectively managing their employees. It is a compilation of selected cutting-edge articles published in the journal during the past five years. It is di vided into the following seven sections which represent important HR issues facing ex ecutives today (and in the near future): Section 1. The Human Resource Function in Transition Section 2. Strategic Human Resource Planning Section 3. Mergers and AcquiSitions Section 4. Performance Appraisal and Performance Management Section 5.",

This edited collection has been compiled with the aim of developing our understanding and practice of HRM in an African context within an increasingly global work milieu. Chapters focus on different African countries and are underpinned by a critical approach to HRM, which goes beyond focussing on the business cases but considers the sensitivity of the national context. The authors will draw on various types of research (conceptual, theoretical and empirical) and incorporate contextual issues such as technology, politics, culture, and economics to supplement the readers\u2019 insights into the current state of human resource management in African countries. By highlighting theoretical underpinnings and emphasising the practical relevance of HR issues, this proposed book will offer an insightful guide for students and scholars interested in HR and management in developing economies.",

        "description": "This is a contributed text that challenges the traditional way in which the management of people is often viewed solely within an economic framework by acknowledging that human relations are social, reciprocal, multi-dimensional and embedded in group and societal dynamics. The contributions come from a range of international experts and explore the tensions that come about due to a neglect of the social nature of human relations in the workplace.",

        "description": "The third volume in our acclaimed series takes us into the mid-1950s as Linus learns to talk, Snoopy begins to explore his eccentricities (including his hilarious first series of impressions), Lucy's unrequited crush on Schroeder takes final shape, and Charlie Brown becomes...well, even more Charlie Brown-ish! Over half of the strips in this volume have never been printed since their original appearance in newspapers a half-century ago! Even the most dedicated Peanuts collector/fan is sure to find many new treasures. The Complete Peanuts will run 25 volumes, collecting two years chronologically at a rate of two a year for twelve years. Each volume is designed by the award-winning cartoonist Seth (It's a Good Life If You Don't Weaken) and features impeccable production values; every single strip from Charles M. Schulz's 50-year American classic is reproduced better than ever before. This volume includes an introduction by Matt Groening (The Simpsons) as well as the popular Complete Peanuts index, a hit with librarians and collectors alike, and an epilogue by series editor Gary Groth. 2005 Eisner Award winner, Best Archival Collection/Project.",

        "description": "Roger Dahl's Zero Gravity cartoon strip has been a popular feature of Japan's leading English-language daily newspaper, The Japan Times, since 1991. Now, for the first time, Roger Dahl's Comic Japan brings together the best of Zero Gravity in book form. Offering a Western artist's take on Japan, the strip stars Larry and Lily, a young American couple working as English teachers in Tokyo. Larry and Lily never manage to fully integrate into Japanese society, and Zero Gravity takes a whimsical approach to the meeting of cultures as well as the quirky dynamics of changing relationships between generations and subgroups within Japan. Besides Larry and Lily, Zero Gravity features their close friends, the Koyama family, whose three very different generations encounter plenty of misunderstandings of their own! This anthology contains eight chapters featuring the best selection of strips from Larry and Lily's life in Japan. Each chapter opens with a brief passage about its theme, and a 3-page illustrated introduction provides information about Dahl, his career, and his inspiration for Zero Gravity. Graphic novels and comic books have experienced explosive growth in recent years, and Roger Dahl's Comic Japan offers humorous cross-cultural observations that will delight visitors to Japan and armchair travelers alike.",

        "description": "Cartoonist Winsor McCay (1869\u20131934) is rightfully celebrated for the skillful draftsmanship and inventive design sense he displayed in the comic strips Little Nemo in Slumberland and Dream of the Rarebit Fiend. McCay crafted narratives of anticipation, abundance, and unfulfilled longing. This book explores McCay\u2019s interest in dream imagery in relation to the larger preoccupation with fantasy that dominated the popular culture of early twentieth-century urban America. McCay\u2019s role as a pioneer of early comics has been documented; yet, no existing study approaches him and his work from an art historical perspective, giving close readings of individual artworks while situating his output within the larger visual culture and the rise of modernism. From circus posters and vaudeville skits to department store window displays and amusement park rides, McCay found fantastical inspiration in New York City\u2019s burgeoning entertainment and retail districts. Wide Awake in Slumberland connects McCay\u2019s work to relevant children\u2019s literature, advertising, architecture, and motion pictures in order to demonstrate the artist\u2019s sophisticated blending and remixing of multiple forms from mass culture. Studying this interconnection in McCay\u2019s work and, by extension, the work of other early twentieth-century cartoonists, Roeder traces the web of relationships connecting fantasy, leisure, and consumption. Readings of McCay\u2019s drawings and the eighty-one black and white and color illustrations reveal a man who was both a ready participant and an incisive critic of the rising culture of fantasy and consumerism.",

As Kaplan notes in the Introduction, \u201ceverything we do, we do for one of three reasons: because we love someone, because we hate someone, or because we\u2019re hungry.\u201d No one can argue with that, or anything else in this wickedly funny new collection..",

Just because the rest of the Fox family-from older brother Peter and sister Paige to parents Roger and Andy-haven't quite accepted his Dominion Over All isn't cause for concern. Math geeks, Jason is convinced, will govern the earth, and he will lead the way. FoxTrotius Maximus: A FoxTrot Treasury, picks up on Jason's megalomania and runs with it . . . and it doesn't stop until readers are out of breath from laughing so hard. FoxTrotius Maximus combines the works Your Momma Thinks Square Roots Are Vegetables, Who's Up for Some Bonding, and Am I a Mutant or What? That means longtime FoxTrot readers and new fans alike are treated to Jason and his friend Marcus's never-ending antics, Andy's ongoing allergy fun, Peter's latest hot haircut, and a host of pop-culture trends and topics including music piracy, video games, and The Lord of the Rings trilogy. Timely, topical, and terribly funny! This latest FoxTrot treasury represents the ninth anthology of Amend's wildly successful comic strip, based upon the cartoonist's 17 previous books and his daily and Sunday syndicated appearances in more than 1,000 newspapers worldwide. FoxTrot truly is one of America's all-time favorite comics, and combined sales of nearly three million copies show that Amend knows how to capture and keep his audience's humor-loving attention. All hail, FoxTrotius Maximus!",

        "description": "This fifth edition of Chassin's Operative Strategy in General Surgery is a major revision that strives to remain faithful to the purpose and tone of Dr. Chassin\u2019s original text. This unique textbook provides an emphasis on surgical strategy that is unmatched by other textbooks of surgical technique. The text explains the conceptual basis of each operation, outlines strategies to avoid common pitfalls, and carefully describes and beautifully illustrates the technical steps of each operation. The fifth edition preserves the unique qualities of its previous edition while providing a comprehensive update. This updated volume also features a vast amount of richly detailed artwork and operative photographs, which help depict operative techniques step-by-step. No other text so successfully combines operative technique with the concept of strategy \u2013 that is, key governing principles that dictate safe surgery and avoidance of complications. There are books of technique, there are books about complications, and there are books about the rationale involved in the treatment of various kinds of surgical pathology. Chassin\u2019s combines all three. Chassin\u2019s Operative Strategy in General Surgery: An Expositive Atlas Fifth Edition comprehensively covers all non-vascular operations commonly performed by general surgeons. This edition expands this comprehensive general surgery reference while remaining true to the special character of the work. The revision expands upon procedures not covered in the previous edition and incorporates new techniques into many other chapters.",

        "description": "Is there any evidence that we can reduce the incidence of mental ill health? Is it possible to prevent recurrence of mental ill health? Aspirations to achieve both these goals have featured in mental health policy and practice for over 100 years. This comprehensive and accessible book draws on research on the development and persistence of behavioural problems in childhood, adult depression and schizophrenia. The association between social disadvantage and mental ill health, as well as the need for preventive care to start from conception and the crucial importance of maternal mental health, are discussed. A variety of prominent programmes which have good evidence of efficacy are described. These include: Targeted approaches with individuals and families Macro policies affecting housing and employment Lifestyle contributions such as diet and exercise However, some attempts to achieve preventive benefits have not succeeded, and reflecting on these problems is an important feature of this review. Jennifer Newton has written extensively on these issues for over twenty years, and her careful examination of the research literature provides a succinct overview of the state of current knowledge which will benefit mental health professionals, and students of health psychology and public health. It also takes a life course perspective, and considers how, when and why vulnerability persists through childhood into adult life, so will interest those whose work focuses on child well-being.",

        "description": "Building on earlier patient-empowerment movements, consumer- and advocate-driven mental health self-help (MHSH) initiatives currently outnumber traditional mental health organizations. At the same time, this apparent success raises significant questions about their short-term efficacy and their value to lasting recovery. Mental Health Self-Help assembles the state of the evidence on the effectiveness of MHSH, beginning with the individual and larger social factors behind the expansion of consumer-directed services. Clearly organized and accessibly written, the book traces the development and evolution of MHSH as both alternative and adjunct to traditional mental health structures, offers research-based perspectives on the various forms of MHSH, and identifies potential areas for consumer initiatives to work with\u2014and help improve\u2014mental health systems. Contributors weigh strengths and limitations, raise research and methodology questions, and discuss funding and training issues to give readers a deeper understanding of the field and an informed look at its future impact on mental health treatment. Individual chapters cover the spectrum of contemporary self-help initiatives in mental health, including: \u2022 Online mutual aid groups. \u2022 Consumer-run drop-in centers. \u2022 Family and caregiver groups. \u2022 Certified peer support specialists. \u2022 Consumer advocacy initiatives. \u2022 Technical assistance organizations. \u2022 Professional/self-help collaborations.

Its multidisciplinary approach incorporates social, psychological, biological and philosophical perspectives on the female body. The contributions, from notable academics in the field of women's mental health, examine the relationship between women's bodies, society and culture, demonstrating how the body has become a platform for women's expression of their distress and anguish. The book is divided into six sections, all centred on the theme of the body, covering: The body at risk. The hurting body. The reproductive body. The interactive body. Body-sensitive therapies. The body on my mind. All professionals involved in women's mental health will welcome this exploration of the complexities involved in the relationship between women bodies and their mental health.",

Exploring issues covering psychological, social, and cultural aspects of mental health problems, it looks at epidemiological data that shows increased frequency in different clinical aspects of many psychiatric disorders, the biological and endocrinological concomitants of mental health, and eating disorders, perinatal psychiatric disorders, and the long term effects of abuse - helping readers to appreciate the societal, parental, and personal consequences of mental health problems. Part one is dedicated to fundamental aspects in women's mental health. It covers topics from women's health as a global issue to different medical psychological theories, giving an overview of gender in mental health. The second examines clinical aspects of women and mental health. In part three, special clinical topics such as PTSD, self-harm, menopause, violence and its management are investigated. Part four focuses on parental psychiatric disorders, clarifying how mental health and behavioural problems in children can be a marker or consequence of maternal distress. The final two parts look at the topics of women and disability, and legislation and policy. A book of exceptional scope and depth, it will be essential for all those health professionals involved in managing mental health problems in women",

        "description": "Educational institutions in which administrators, managers and teachers will be working in the late 1990's will be far different from those oftoday. Schools, which until recently were lagging behind in the implementation of information technology (IT) in their administration and management, are now attempting to close the gap. A massive and rapid computerization process in schools, school districts and throughout the other Ievels of the educational system, including universities, has made computers an integral part of the educational management scene. A computer on the desk of every educational management statT might become a reality in the near future. The term \"IT\" includes three main components: hardware, software - mainly management information systems (MIS)/decision support systems (DSS) and human factors. Presently, successful implementation depends on adequate software and on human factors. MIS/DSSs are being implemented with the aim of providing meaningful support for school employees in their daily activities, and to improve their performance, etfectiveness and efficiency. Much like at universities, usable and accessible school databases are being established, encompassing data on students, teachers, employees, classrooms, grade Ievels, courses, student achievements and behavior, school space, curriculum, finance, inventory, transportation, etc.",

        "description": "Business modelling is a vast arena of research and practice, which is gaining increasing important in the rapid development of e-commerce, globalization, and in particular, the movement toward global e-business. The ability to utilize advanced computing technology to model, analyse and simulate various aspects of ever-changing businesses has made a significant impact on the way businesses are designed and run these days. With the current global e-business and e-commerce initiatives, it has become important that all businesses carefully validate their business objectives, requirements, and strategies through a careful process of formal business modelling. It is important for effective enterprise decision making to have clear, concise business models that allow the extraction of critical value from business processes and specify the rules to be globally enforced. Particularly in e-business specifications, the need to be unambiguous, accurate, and complete becomes even greater, because there may be no human mediator or agent to rely on in complex or unforeseen situations. Business Modelling: Multidisciplinary Approaches - Economics, Operational, and Information Systems Perspectives, arranged in three parts, brings scholarly perspectives from various disciplines to bear on some of the critical aspects of business modeling. The first part (chapters 1-8) focuses on business modelling fundamentals and starts with a series of economics and operations research perspectives. The second part (chapters 9-19) concentrates on modelling in electronic businesses and focuses on Management Information Systems and Decision Support Systems. The third part (chapters 20-22) centers on multidisciplinary business modelling progress, in particular on the seminal work of Professor Andrew B. Whinston.",

        "description": "Updated to textbook form by popular demand, this second edition discusses diverse mathematical models used in economics, ecology, and the environmental sciences with emphasis on control and optimization. It is intended for graduate and upper-undergraduate course use, however, applied mathematicians, industry practitioners, and a vast number of interdisciplinary academics will find the presentation highly useful. Core topics of this text are: \u00b7 Economic growth and technological development \u00b7 Population dynamics and human impact on the environment \u00b7 Resource extraction and scarcity \u00b7 Air and water contamination \u00b7 Rational management of the economy and environment \u00b7 Climate change and global dynamics The step-by-step approach taken is problem-based and easy to follow. The authors aptly demonstrate that the same models may be used to describe different economic and environmental processes and that similar investigation techniques are applicable to analyze various models. Instructors will appreciate the substantial flexibility that this text allows while designing their own syllabus. Chapters are essentially self-contained and may be covered in full, in part, and in any order. Appropriate one- and two-semester courses include, but are not limited to, Applied Mathematical Modeling, Mathematical Methods in Economics and Environment, Models of Biological Systems, Applied Optimization Models, and Environmental Models. Prerequisites for the courses are Calculus and, preferably, Differential Equations.",

Chapter 2-4 treat manual, semiautomatic (punched card), and automatic equipment, respectively. Chapter 4 treats the automatic computer in terms of a specific existing computer, the IBM 650 computer. The internal operation of computers, emphasizing organization rather than details, is treated in Chapter 5. Chapter 6 develops in some detail the vital and rarely treated topic of representation of data in computer storages and other topics in advanced programming. Chapter 7 develops the important topic of sorting, giving numerous explicit sorting algorithms and comparative evaluations. Chapter 8 treats the use of auxiliary computer programs in programming (automatic programming), program analysis (debugging), and manual control. Chapter 9 draws on its predecessors for a brief discussion of the art and technique of system design.",

        "description": "This open access book is part of the LAMBDA Project (Learning, Applying, Multiplying Big Data Analytics), funded by the European Union, GA No. 809965. Data Analytics involves applying algorithmic processes to derive insights. Nowadays it is used in many industries to allow organizations and companies to make better decisions as well as to verify or disprove existing theories or models. The term data analytics is often used interchangeably with intelligence, statistics, reasoning, data mining, knowledge discovery, and others. The goal of this book is to introduce some of the definitions, methods, tools, frameworks, and solutions for big data processing, starting from the process of information extraction and knowledge representation, via knowledge processing and analytics to visualization, sense-making, and practical applications. Each chapter in this book addresses some pertinent aspect of the data processing chain, with a specific focus on understanding Enterprise Knowledge Graphs, Semantic Big Data Architectures, and Smart Data Analytics solutions. This book is addressed to graduate students from technical disciplines, to professional audiences following continuous education short courses, and to researchers from diverse areas following self-study courses. Basic skills in computer science, mathematics, and statistics are required.",

        "description": "In this book, T. L. Short places the notorious difficulties of Peirce's important writings in a more productive light, arguing that he wrote philosophy as a scientist, by framing conjectures intended to be refined or superseded in the inquiries they initiate. He argues also that Peirce held that the methods and metaphysics of modern science are amended as inquiry progresses, making metaphysics a branch of empirical knowledge. Additionally, Short shows that Peirce's scientific work expanded empiricism on empirical grounds, grounding his phenomenology and subverting the fact/value dichotomy, and that he understood statistical explanations in nineteenth-century science as reintroducing the idea of final causation, now made empirical. Those innovations underlie Peirce's late ideas of a normative science and of philosophy as a branch of science. Short's rich and original study shows us how to read Peirce's writings and why they are worth reading.",

        "description": "Logic has attained in our century a development incomparably greater than in any past age of its long history, and this has led to such an enrichment and proliferation of its aspects, that the problem of some kind of unified recom prehension of this discipline seems nowadays unavoidable. This splitting into several subdomains is the natural consequence of the fact that Logic has intended to adopt in our century the status of a science. This always implies that the general optics, under which a certain set of problems used to be con sidered, breaks into a lot of specialized sectors of inquiry, each of them being characterized by the introduction of specific viewpoints and of technical tools of its own. The first impression, that often accompanies the creation of one of such specialized branches in a diSCipline, is that one has succeeded in isolating the 'scientific core' of it, by restricting the somehow vague and redundant generality of its original 'philosophical' configuration. But, after a while, it appears that some of the discarded aspects are indeed important and a new specialized domain of investigation is created to explore them. By follOwing this procedure, one finally finds himself confronted with such a variety of independent fields of research, that one wonders whether the fact of labelling them under a common denomination be nothing but the contingent effect of a pure historical tradition.",

        "description": "This book provides a comprehensive survey of Edmund Burke's historical thought, a neglected area of both Burke scholarship and historiography. Ranging from Burke's general conception of history to his accounts of English, European, American, Irish and Asian-Muslim history, this book offers much-needed depth and context to his political life. Sora Sato illuminates Burke's ideas on civilisation and world order with careful analysis of both his well-known historical concepts, such as the ancient constitution of England and the spirit of chivalry, as well as his lesser-known opinions on war and the military. Written with clarity and precision, this book is an invaluable reference for scholars of Burke, early modern European history and political philosophy.",

        "description": "Kant said that logic had not had to take a single step forward since Aristotle, but German Idealists in the following generation made concerted efforts to re-think the logical foundations of philosophy. In this book, Jacob McNulty offers a new interpretation of Hegel's Logic, the key work of his philosophical system. McNulty shows that Hegel is responding to a perennial problem in the history and philosophy of logic: the logocentric predicament. In Hegel, we find an answer to a question so basic that it cannot be posed without risking incoherence: what is the justification for logic? How can one justify logic without already relying upon it? The answer takes the form of re-thinking the role of metaphysics in philosophy, so that logic assumes a new position as derivative rather than primary. This important book will appeal to a wide range of readers in Hegel studies and beyond.",

This edition was well received, with notable reviews. Since its publication, the debate over the advent of global warming at least partially brought on by human enterprise has continued to ebb and flow, depending literally on the weather, politics, and media coverage of climate summits and debates. Advances in research also change the discourse as new data is collected and new scientific projects continue to explore and explain global warming and climate change. Thus, a new, Second Edition updates more than half of the original entries and adds new perspectives and content to keep students and researchers up-to-date in a field that has proven provocatively lively.",

Now as the world is getting technologically and industrially more advanced, resulting in the setting up of huge factories, the environmental pollution is heading towards alarming levels. It is obvious that more factories mean more pollution and more carbon emissions, which highly aggravate global warming. Keeping this in view, the policy makers from all over the w\u00acorld have decided to unite and chalk out a plan to keep the adverse effects of global warming within safety limits. This book is also an effort in this direction. Defining in detail the major aspects of global warming, it discusses at length its causes and effects. Taking a close look at the global response to contain global warming, it also explains the important provisions of Copenhagen Summit, Kyoto Protocol and Post-Kyoto Protocol Negotiations on Green-house Gas Emissions.",

Energy and environment policies and strategies are scientifically discussed to expose the best ways to reduce global warming effects and protect the environment and energy sources affected by human activities. The importance of green energy consumption on the reduction of global warming, energy saving and energy security are also discussed. This book also focuses on energy management and conservation strategies for better utilization of energy sources and technologies in buildings and industry as well as ways of improving energy efficiency at the end use, and introduces basic methods for designing and sizing cost-effective systems and determining whether it is economically efficient to invest in specific energy efficiency or renewable energy projects, and describes energy audit producers commonly used to improve the energy efficiency of residential and commercial buildings as well as industrial facilities. These features and more provide the tools necessary to reduce global warming and to improve energy management leading to higher energy efficiencies. In order to reduce the negative effects of global warming due to excessive use of fossil fuel technologies, the following alternative technologies are introduced from the engineering perspective: fuel cells, solar power generation technologies, energy recovery technologies, hydrogen energy technologies, wind energy technologies, geothermal energy technologies, and biomass energy technologies. These technologies are presented in detail and modeling studies including case studies can also be found in this book.",

Considering data on both sources and sinks for atmospheric carbon and various conceptual schemes of the global carbon dioxide cycle, they suggest a new approach to studies of the problem of the greenhouse effect. They assess the role of different types of soil and vegetation in the assimilation of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and discuss models of the atmosphere ocean gas exchange and its role in the carbon dioxide cycle, paying special attention to the role of the Arctic Basin. The authors also consider models of other global atmospheric cycles for a range of atmospheric constituents, and conclude by drawing together a range of scenarios on modelling the global carbon cycle.",

This book explores both the problems and the opportunities presented by international agreements, and examines the technological developments and policy goals that can be pursued to effect the changes necessary. Specific steps are proposed in the form of a list of priorities. This book represents a cooperative enterprise between two authors of different backgrounds - engineering and international relations - and is directed to an educated but non-professional lay audience without any formal training in either science or international relations.

        "description": "Extremely topical over recent years, global warming has been the subject of a huge and growing amount of literature. Current literature however tends to fall into two camps: that which is highly scientific in nature and inaccessible to the average student, and that which is directed to the \"lay\" reader and lacks detail required by students. This book successfully bridges this gap, prividing an accessible explanation of the physical mechanisms of global warming - discussed within the widercontext of climate change.",

Counterterrorism operative Mitch Rapp and his colleague Mike Nash may have finally met their match. The CIA has intercepted two terrorist cells, but a third\u2014led by a dangerous mastermind determined to become al-Qaeda\u2019s new leader\u2014is believed to be on the loose. With such a terrifyingly deadly enemy out there, Rapp needs the best of the best by his side and he believes he has that with Nash. Together, they have made careers out of meeting violence with extreme violence and have never wavered in the top-secret fight against the war on terrorism. Both have been forced to lie to virtually every single person they care about, and both have soldiered on with the knowledge that their lethal tactics have saved thousands of lives. But certain leaders on Capitol Hill are pushing to have men like Rapp and Nash put on a short leash. And then one spring afternoon in Washington, DC, everything changes. With nonstop action and ripped-from-the-headlines writing, Extreme Measures is the political thriller of our time and proves once again that, \u201cin the world of black-ops thrillers, Mitch Rapp continues to be among the best of the best\u201d (Booklist, starred review).",

Sit back and enjoy the ride.' Peter Frankopan, author of The Silk Roads '[An] engaging and well-researched book... Jenner brings his material to vivid life' Observer Celebrity, with its neon glow and selfie pout, strikes us as hypermodern. But the famous and infamous have been thrilling, titillating, and outraging us for much longer than we might realise. Whether it was the scandalous Lord Byron, whose poetry sent female fans into an erotic frenzy; or the cheetah-owning, coffin-sleeping, one-legged French actress Sarah Bernhardt, who launched a violent feud with her former best friend; or Edmund Kean, the dazzling Shakespearean actor whose monstrous ego and terrible alcoholism saw him nearly murdered by his own audience - the list of stars whose careers burned bright before the Age of Television is extensive and thrillingly varied. In this ambitious history, that spans the Bronze Age to the coming of Hollywood's Golden Age, Greg Jenner assembles a vibrant cast of over 125 actors, singers, dancers, sportspeople, freaks, demigods, ruffians, and more, in search of celebrity's historical roots. He reveals why celebrity burst into life in the early eighteenth century, how it differs to ancient ideas of fame, the techniques through which it was acquired, how it was maintained, the effect it had on public tastes, and the psychological burden stardom could place on those in the glaring limelight. DEAD FAMOUS is a surprising, funny, and fascinating exploration of both a bygone age and how we came to inhabit our modern, fame obsessed society.",

        "description": "Widely publicized in mass media worldwide, high-profile tragedies and celebrity scandals\u2014the untimely deaths of Michael Jackson and Princess Diana, the embarrassing affairs of Tiger Woods and President Clinton, the 9/11 attacks or the Challenger space shuttle explosion\u2014often provoke nervous laughter and black humor. If in the past this snarky folklore may have been shared among friends and uttered behind closed doors, today the Internet's ubiquity and instant interactivity propels such humor across a much more extensive and digitally mediated discursive space. New media not only let more people \"in on the joke,\" but they have also become the \"go-to\" formats for engaging in symbolic interaction, especially in times of anxiety or emotional suppression, by providing users an expansive forum for humorous, combative, or intellectual communication, including jokes that cross the line of propriety and good taste. Moving through engaging case studies of Internet-derived humor about momentous disasters in recent American popular culture and history, The Last Laugh chronicles how and why new media have become a predominant means of vernacular expression. Trevor J. Blank argues that computer-mediated communication has helped to compensate for users' sense of physical detachment in the \"real\" world, while generating newly meaningful and dynamic opportunities for the creation and dissemination of folklore. Drawing together recent developments in new media studies with the analytical tools of folklore studies, he makes a strong case for the significance to contemporary folklore of technologically driven trends in folk and mass culture.",

        "description": "This innovative book traces the impact of tradition on modern humour across several Asian countries and their cultures. Using examples from Japan, Korea, Indonesia and Chinese cultures in Mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, the contributors explore the different cultural rules for creating and sharing humour. Humour can be a powerful lubricant when correctly interpreted; mis-interpreted, it is likely to cause considerable setbacks. Over time, it has emerged and submerged in different periods and different forms in all these countries but today\u2019s conventions still reflect traditional attitudes to and assumptions about what is appropriate in creating and using humour. Under close examination, Milner Davis and her colleagues show how forms and conventions that differ from those in the west can also be seen to possess elements in common. With examples including Mencian and other classical texts, Balinese traditional verbal humour, Korean and Taiwanese workplace humour, Japanese laughter ceremonies, performances and cartoons, as well as contemporary Chinese-language films and videos, they engage with a wide range of forms and traditions. This fascinating collection of studies will be of great interest to students and scholars of many Asian cultures, and also to those with a broader interest in humour studies. It highlights the increasing importance of understanding a wider range of cultural values in the present era of globalized communication and the importance of reliable studies of why and how cultures that are geographically related differ in their traditional uses of and assumptions about humour.",

        "description": "The idea of human cruelty to animals so consumes novelist Elizabeth Costello in her later years that she can no longer look another person in the eye: humans, especially meat-eating ones, seem to her to be conspirators in a crime of stupefying magnitude taking place on farms and in slaughterhouses, factories, and laboratories across the world. Costello's son, a physics professor, admires her literary achievements, but dreads his mother\u2019s lecturing on animal rights at the college where he teaches. His colleagues resist her argument that human reason is overrated and that the inability to reason does not diminish the value of life; his wife denounces his mother\u2019s vegetarianism as a form of moral superiority. At the dinner that follows her first lecture, the guests confront Costello with a range of sympathetic and skeptical reactions to issues of animal rights, touching on broad philosophical, anthropological, and religious perspectives. Painfully for her son, Elizabeth Costello seems offensive and flaky, but\u2014dare he admit it?\u2014strangely on target. In this landmark book, Nobel Prize\u2013winning writer J. M. Coetzee uses fiction to present a powerfully moving discussion of animal rights in all their complexity. He draws us into Elizabeth Costello\u2019s own sense of mortality, her compassion for animals, and her alienation from humans, even from her own family. In his fable, presented as a Tanner Lecture sponsored by the University Center for Human Values at Princeton University, Coetzee immerses us in a drama reflecting the real-life situation at hand: a writer delivering a lecture on an emotionally charged issue at a prestigious university. Literature, philosophy, performance, and deep human conviction\u2014Coetzee brings all these elements into play. As in the story of Elizabeth Costello, the Tanner Lecture is followed by responses treating the reader to a variety of perspectives, delivered by leading thinkers in different fields. Coetzee\u2019s text is accompanied by an introduction by political philosopher Amy Gutmann and responsive essays by religion scholar Wendy Doniger, primatologist Barbara Smuts, literary theorist Marjorie Garber, and moral philosopher Peter Singer, author of Animal Liberation. Together the lecture-fable and the essays explore the palpable social consequences of uncompromising moral conflict and confrontation.",

When animals take possession of words and, especially begin with names, they significantly move to the realm of freedom, Just like slaves who have acquired manumission and can speak and write freely. In this book of short stories, the animals assume the characters of humans and therefore speak with authority of people in different life circumstances. Other animals of the sane or different species adapt and adopt certain well-defined stratagems in order to cope with the prolongation of their life spaces. In this respect, they serve as role models or prime examples of emulation. ANIMAL SHORT STORIES should provide meaningful reading for children and young adults. Clement B. G. London, Ed. D.",

Traditional strategic management frameworks often fail in this context. Therefore, we present \"scenario-based strategic planning\" as a framework for strategic management in an uncertain world. Previous approaches to scenario planning were complex and focused on the long term, but the approach developed by Roland Berger and the Center for Strategy and Scenario Planning at HHL Leipzig Graduate School of Management is different. By designing appropriate tools and integrating scenario planning into strategic planning, we have made our approach less complex and easier for firms to apply. We illustrate the approach with examples from different industries.",

        "description": "The Geneva Association and Risk Economics The Geneva Association The Geneva Association (International Association for the Study of Insurance Economics) commenced its activities in June 1973, on the initiative of twenty-two members in eight European countries. It now has fifty-four members in sixteen countries in Europe and in the United States. The members of the association are insurance companies which provide financial support for its activities. The aims and strategy of the Geneva Association were clearly defined in 1971 by the founding committee. They were set forth in the first report to the Assembly of Members in 1974: \"To make an original contribution to the progress of insurance by objective studies on the interdependence between economics and insurance.\" In pursuit of this objective, the Association strives to place insurance problems in the context of the modern economy and to overcome the antagonism between different groups and institutions by showing that they all have a common interest in tackling the problem of risk in a changing world. In consequence, the studies made by the Association had to move away from the subjects familiar to insurance professionals and explore related fields, dealing with opinions and behavior falling outside the profession's vii FOREWORD viii traditional framework of analysis. It is in this direction that the Association's preoccupations have been directed from the beginning, towards areas in which insurance activities come into contact with those of other economic sectors such as government, banking, manufacturing, and households.",

These studies span multiple levels of analysis and draws on a range of disciplines, including strategic management, economics, and economic geography. Managing Decline: A Research Overview provides a summary of this research by focusing on three key levels of analysis: industries, clusters, and organizations. The targeted reviews in this book map each individual level of analysis separately and the discussion section outlines overarching themes regarding decline and its management. The three levels are analysed by identifying different forms, causes, processes, and management options regarding decline. This is accompanied by the identification of key academic discourses that have been used to analyse decline. The discussion section highlights broader themes regarding the nature and management of decline that span across the different levels of analysis. This book provides an easy to access summary on the nature and management of decline for academic scholars and business practitioners, and is essential reading for getting an overview of this broad field of research\"--",

        "description": "This book develops a property rights approach to firm strategy and demonstrates how it helps address key challenges in strategic management research. It shows that the property rights approach holds important implications both for entrepreneurship and organizational learning theory. Property rights have direct implications for strategic management, as control over assets has an immediate link to the creation and appropriation of economic value. For a firm to execute a competitive strategy, it must hold rights to appropriate resources. This book will appeal to scholars working in the fields of strategic management, organizational theory and resource allocation. It is an invaluable summary of two decades of groundbreaking research.",

        "description": "The innovative and unique feature of this book is that it does not contain theoretical concept that cannot be translated into practice. The model which introduces this volume sets the stage for addressing the major phases of the strategic management process: environmental analysis, strategy formulation and development, strategy evaluation and control. Its conceptual and operational structure is described in the first part, together with a practically oriented definition of strategy, and a brief discussion of the logic and benefits of the judgmental modeling approach to decision making. The second part critically addresses the classical approaches to the analysis of the external and internal environmental factors, which have an impact on the \u201cfunctioning\u201d of the basic model, i.e. the structural characteristics of the industry context, and the companies\u2019 technical, organizational, financial, and human resources, including the translation into operational models of otherwise rather theoretical concepts.",

        "description": "The ping-pong diplomacy and its aftermath discussion, coupled with the entry of communist China into the United Nations and the subsequent expulsion of Taiwan, will generate considerable political dialogue about the changing balance of power and the fate of the other China. These political discussions will obviously overshadow the true role and function of the existence of Taiwan. Given the time, Taiwan could become a model for the development process for other emerging countries. Taiwan's experience with eco nomic development has real relevance for many countries. For exam ple, in less than two decades Taiwan has achieved the industrial and economic growth that should well make it the envy of nearly all other developing nations. Its per capita income is exceeded only by Japan among the countries of the Far East. Yet, despite vigorous economic and industrial growth, obvious breakdowns in this economic progress come into view. The lack of managerial input threatens to become a real bottleneck. The study reported in this volume examines the feasibility and utility of transferring advanced management know-how and practices into the industrial enterprises in Taiwan in order to generate further economic and industrial growth. The study itself concerns management practices and effectiveness of American subsidiaries, Japanese sub sidiaries, and comparable local firms in Taiwan.",

He's captained Essendon to a premiership, won a Brownlow Medal, been voted his club's Best and Fairest four times, selected as an All-Australian in five International Series, and been named the third greatest Essendon player of all time. But Hird's record as a footballer is only part of his story. In the same year he won the Brownlow he graduated as an engineer. Despite the workload and the pressures of professional football and captaining his club, he has worked as a stockbroker, an airline employee, a television executive, a media personality and a partner in a sports marketing consultancy. His perspective on the game is informed by a wealth of life knowledge, and his perspective on life is informed by an equal wealth of football experience. Reading the Play is a fascinating account of his life and his views, both on the sport he loves and on the things he finds important, from the fundamentals of family, to self-discipline and the power of courage. It's frank, informed, entertaining and inspiring. And, like Hird himself, completely unique.",

        "description": "America\u2019s most popular sports media figure tells it like it is in this surprisingly personal book, not only dishing out his signature, uninhibited opinions but also revealing the challenges he overcame in childhood as well as at ESPN, and who he really is when the cameras are off. Stephen A. Smith has never been handed anything, nor was he an overnight success. Growing up poor in Queens, the son of Caribbean immigrants and the youngest of six children, he was a sports-obsessed kid who faced a number of struggles, from undiagnosed dyslexia to getting enough cereal to fill his bowl. As a basketball player at Winston-Salem State University, he got a glimmer of his true calling when he wrote a newspaper column arguing for the retirement of his own Hall of Fame coach, Clarence Gaines. Smith hustled and rose up from a high school reporter at Daily News (New York) to a general sports columnist at The Philadelphia Inquirer in the 1990s, before getting his own show at ESPN in 2005. After he was unceremoniously fired from the network in 2009, he became even more determined to fight for success. He got himself rehired two years later and, with his razor-sharp intelligence and fearless debate style, found his role on the show he was destined to star in: First Take, the network\u2019s flagship morning program. In Straight Shooter, Smith writes about the greatest highs and deepest lows of his life and career. He gives his thoughts on Skip Bayless, Ray Rice, Colin Kaepernick, the New York Knicks, the Dallas Cowboys, and former President Donald Trump. But he also pulls back the curtain and talks about life beyond the set, sharing authentic stories about his negligent father, his loving mother, being a father himself, his battle with life-threatening COVID-19, and what he really thinks about politics and social issues. He does it all with the same intelligence, humor, and charm that has made him a household name. Provocative, moving, and eye-opening, this book is the perfect gift for lovers of sports, television, and anyone who likes their stories delivered straight to the heart.",

        "description": "A major biography of the greatest men's tennis player of the modern era. There have been other biographies of Roger Federer, but never one with this kind of access to the man himself, his support team, and the most prominent figures in the game, including such rivals as Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic, and Andy Roddick. In THE MASTER, New York Times correspondent Christopher Clarey sits down with Federer and those closest to him to tell the story of the greatest player in men's tennis. Roger Federer has often made it look astonishingly easy through the decades: carving backhands, gliding to forehands, leaping for overheads and, in his most gravity-defying act, remaining high on a pedestal in a world of sports rightfully flooded with cynicism. But his path from temperamental, bleach-blond teenager with dubious style sense to one of the greatest, most self-possessed and elegant of competitors has been a long-running act of will, not destiny. He not only had a great gift. He had grit. Christopher Clarey, one of the top international sportswriters working today, has covered Federer since the beginning of his professional career. He was in Paris on the Suzanne Lenglen Court for Federer's first Grand Slam match and has interviewed him exclusively more than any other journalist since his rise to prominence. Here, Clarey focuses on the pivotal people, places, and moments in Federer's long and rich career: reporting from South Africa, South America, the Middle East, four Grand Slam tournaments, and Federer's native Switzerland. It has been a journey like no other player's, rife with victories and a few crushing defeats, one that has redefined enduring excellence and made Federer a sentimental favorite worldwide. THE MASTER tells the story of Federer's life and career on both an intimate and grand scale, in a way no one else could possibly do.",

Among the authors are women of the gentry (Natalia Grot), the merchant class (Aleksandra Kobiakova), the lower bureaucracy (Praskovia Tatlina), and the serf class (Liubov Nikulina-Kositskaia). They include writers (Elizaveta Lvova, Anastasiia Verbitskaia), a journalist (Emiliia Pimenova), an actress in the provincial theater (Liubov Nikulina-Kositskaia), and two physicians (Varvara Kashevarova-Rudneva, Ekaterina Slanskaia) - one the first woman to earn a medical degree in Russia, the other a doctor in the slums of St. Petersburg. Their memoirs show their fierce engagement in the debate over woman's nature, her duties and responsibilities, her upbringing, and her place in society. Each autobiography is introduced and annotated by Toby Clyman and Judith Vowles, who also provide a general introduction that situates these writings within the Russian and Western autobiographical traditions.",

Eminent Australian women in the volume include Dame Elizabeth Couchman, Dame Kate Campbell, Dame Doris Fitton, Dame Zara Holt and Lady (Maie) Casey. Although many of the women achieved prominence in those professions conventionally regarded as the preserve of women, othersandmdash;such as Ruby Boye-Jones, coast-watcher; Ellen Cashman, union organiser; Elsie Chauvel, film-maker; Dorothy Crawford, radio producer; Ruth Dobson, diplomat; Mary Hodgkin, anthropologist; Margaret Kelly, restaurateur; and Patricia Jarrett, journalistandmdash;demonstrate that some women at least were breaking free of the constraints of traditional expectations. The lives of fifteen Indigenous Australians are included, as are those of a number of immigrants who fled from persecution in Europe to establish a new life in Australia.",

        "description": "Serious illness and mortality, those most universal, unavoidable, and frightening of human experiences, are the focus of this pioneering study which has been hailed as a telling and provocative commentary on our times. As modern medicine has become more scientific and dispassionate, a new literary genre has emerged: pathography, the personal narrative concerning illness, treatment, and sometimes death. Hawkins's sensitive reading of numerous pathographies highlights the assumptions, attitudes, and myths that people bring to the medical encounter. One factor emerges again and again in these case studies: the tendency in contemporary medical practice to focus primarily not on the needs of the individual who is sick but on the condition that we call disease. Pathography allows the individual person a voice-one that asserts the importance of the experiential side of illness, and thus restores the feeling, thinking, experiencing human being to the center of the medical enterprise. Recommended for medical practitioners, the clergy, caregivers, students of popular culture, and the general reader, Reconstructing Illness demonstrates that only when we hear both the doctor's and the patient's voice will we have a medicine that is truly human.",

        "description": "Seeking a job as a first-year teacher, Robin Robertson heads for an interview at the Westminster Rural Agricultural Schools in the spring of 1956. Here, Robin could teach and also coach varsity basketball and counsel students. Amid the pressures of beginning a new career, he starts to wonder whether a big-city person like himself can adapt adequately to the lifestyle of small-town, rural America. This story pictures a way of life that has vanished in all too many places. Many readers will relate to the challenges, conflicts, and rewards between students and an untried but idealistic teacher. Others will recall athletic contests won and lost and perhaps will remember counseling that went way beyond arranging school schedules. The author draws upon forty-three years of educational experience in high school and community college -- focusing on that memorable first year in front of a classroom, being in charge of the community's \"Winter Entertainment Committee\" (basketball games), and creating a newly mandated school guidance program.",

It starts with luring Zeke back to Drago for its annual Lilac Festival, then persuading him to boost the town\u2019s economy. Even if that means matchmaking him with the beautiful Jennifer he\u2019s always longed for. She\u2019ll do it for him, for Jennifer, for Drago. Zeke swore he\u2019d never come back to where he was miserable, other than his connection with Darcie. But maybe being back won\u2019t be so bad.

        "description": "\u2764 He see what she hides . . . even from herself. \u2764 Season in a Small Town -- Autumn Meet Josh Kincannon, high school principal, single father of three, and thus, as he reminds himself ruefully, essentially celibate back into misty memory and forward into the foreseeable future. After three months of trying to work with Vanessa Irish via phone and e-mails on a project to help tiny Drago, Illinois, Josh believes he has an accurate picture of Zeke-Tech's CFO: Conscientious? Oh, yeah. Intelligent? Absolutely. Agreeable? Not so much. Then he catches sight of her wild, vibrant robe and begins to wonder what other elements might form a portrait of Vanessa Irish. Every time she goes into her I'm-so-boring-I-disappear-against-white-walls act, he remembers that vibrant, wild fabric hanging on the corner of a door and he gets curious. And the more curious he becomes, the more he discovers about her that has him feeling things a whole lot hotter than curiosity. Things that shake up life as single parent to his three kids, scrape against his career as high school principal and -- oh, yes -- definitely threaten his stretch of celibacy. Numbers, that's where Vanessa is comfortable. Not all this interaction with people that she's been pitched into. Especially interacting with Josh Kincannon. Why does he insist on drawing her into his small town, his life, his children? And the biggest question -- what kind of man is this, who not only looks at her, but SEES her, when that's the last thing she wants? . . . or is it?

        "description": "A grand epic saga by Robert McKenzie, The Chair series spans centuries, touching the lives of 22 generations of related mothers and daughters, their stories witnessed by a simple pine chair. Resolute, strong, loving, and fiercely protective, these women must strive to pass their values to new generations in a world of racism and sexism, politics, scandal, fashion\u2014even the rise and dominance of baseball. They live in privilege and poverty, with faith and despair, relishing every moment of love even as they suffer abiding grief. In Volume III: Seven, Eight, & Nine, the chair flashes back to pre-Civil War America, featuring a woman from the second Mayflower, her daughter the black-market Irish lace importer, and a Canadian World War I fighter pilot. A blend of history and philosophy told through satire and parody, the story of The Chair could be found in some old trunk in any dusty old attic, but McKenzie breathes it alive with riveting tales that span the real and the imagined.",

        "description": "For half a century at least, I.T. teams have focused on solving business problems through computer technology - and largely ignoring the human element in their interactions with end users. In his new book I.T. IN CRISIS: A NEW BUSINESS MODEL, consultant L. Paul Ouellette shows how to bring the I.T. team into the twenty-first century. Organizations that employ I.T. professionals are facing a new economic landscape - one where closer, more engaged relationships with internal and external customers are not merely nice if you can get it, but essential for organizational survival. I.T.'s old business as usual approach - and let the relationship thing take care of itself - is, Ouellette warns, now a recipe for disaster. I.T.'s challenge is to adapt to the customer-focused operational realities of the twenty-first century. Teams that meet this challenge will thrive, and will create extraordinary opportunities for themselves and their organizations. Teams that don't, Ouellette believes, will be marginalized or phased out. How do we make this (long-overdue) transition? By upgrading the I.T. Professional's skill sets - and moving from the back room to the forefront of the business, the place where person-to-person connections with customers as human beings take place. In I.T. IN CRISIS: A NEW BUSINESS MODEL, Ouellette offers proven, real-world strategies for I.T. teams to forge closer bonds with their end users. He shows I.T. professionals how to change the way their customers think about I.T., how to improve I.T.'s standing within their own organizations, and how to enhance their own careers -Paul offers the 1 tool to turn negative relations into a positive one. Methods for successfully conducting the 3 main points of your clients' interactions, learn what clients really want from I.T. and the 5 steps to building your sustainable service strategy. Building very specific empathy, listening skills, rapport-building, and overall relationship management capacities. Ouellette also includes the case studies and action forms that will help I.T. teams to execute on the book's core concept. Today's business environment is highly competitive. In order to survive, organizations must create new business models that focus \"like a laser beam: \" on the customer. For those who work in Information Technology (I.T.) customer relations is no longer a \"nice to have skill, but rather a \"must have: \" skill. The average professional Information Technologist is lacking skills in this area - and thus I.T. faces a crisis. For the first time since the introduction of computer technology to the world of business, I.T. funding has been reduced, and investments going into computer business technology are declining. I.T. is no longer seen as the savior of a company's bottom line. This state of affairs actually represents a new opportunity for I.T. If we make a conscious decision to conduct business differently, upgrade our skills, and focus on the customer - we can get the credit, attention, and recognition we deserve. Computer technology solutions are but one part of what we offer. In the twenty-first century, we need to play a much broader role ... build stronger relationships with the people we serve ... and become an irreplaceable part of the client's business solution. Addressing the problems and offering corrective strategies facing today's I.T. professional are the sole purposes of this book. Once we do this, we will not only succeed, we will thrive! I.T. IN CRISIS: A NEW BUSINESS MODEL strategizes how to make this transition.",

        "description": "Alan Grant, Scotland Yard Inspector is feeling bored while confined to bed in hospital with a broken leg. Marta Hallard, an actress friend of his, suggests that he should amuse himself by researching a historical mystery. She brings him some pictures of historical characters, aware of Grant's interest in human faces. He becomes intrigued by a portrait of King Richard III. He prides himself on being able to read a person's character from his appearance, and King Richard seems to him a gentle, kind and wise man. Why is everyone so sure that he was a cruel murderer? With the help of other friends and acquaintances, Grant investigates Richard's life and the case of the Princes in the Tower, testing out his theories on the doctors and nurses who attend to him. Grant spends weeks pondering historical information and documents with the help of Brent Carradine, a likable young American researcher working in the British Museum. Using his detective's logic, he tries to come to the conclusion whether the claim of Richard being a murderer is a fabrication of Tudor propaganda, or was he really a monstrous hunchback. The Daughter of Time was voted greatest mystery novel of all time by the Crime Writers' Association in 1990.",

Marta Hallard, an actress friend of his, suggests that he should amuse himself by researching a historical mystery. She brings him some pictures of historical characters, aware of Grant's interest in human faces. He becomes intrigued by a portrait of King Richard III. He prides himself on being able to read a person's character from his appearance, and King Richard seems to him a gentle, kind and wise man. Why is everyone so sure that he was a cruel murderer? With the help of other friends and acquaintances, Grant investigates Richard's life and the case of the Princes in the Tower, testing out his theories on the doctors and nurses who attend to him. Grant spends weeks pondering historical information and documents with the help of Brent Carradine, a likable young American researcher working in the British Museum. Using his detective's logic, he tries to come to the conclusion whether the claim of Richard being a murderer is a fabrication of Tudor propaganda, or was he really a monstrous hunchback. The Daughter of Time was voted greatest mystery novel of all time by the Crime Writers' Association in 1990.",

This Christmas season of 1887 should be very merry indeed, as she has two. One seems simple enough-a surveillance job for her estranged husband, Frank, a fellow Pinkerton. The other promises to be much more interesting. How did a society matron's valuable necklace, lent a year before to a friend who was then murdered by a thief, turn up around the neck of a young debutante from Chicago's high society? All too soon, Pen's investigations stir up trouble. She'll need more than her trusty lockpicks and derringer this time, with a young mother and child in harm's way, an assassin stalking Frank, and a killer claiming another victim. She turns to allies old and new, including an impulsive young society girl, a snoopy housemaid (who's surprisingly good at knots) and, most of all, a distractingly handsome and supposedly reformed jewel thief. One thing is clear-she's going to need a Christmas miracle to save them all.",

In The Raphael Affair, the first book in the series, we are introduced to Jonathan Argyll, an enthusiastic young art scholar from England who has followed his suspicions about a long-lost Raphael painting to a small church in Rome. Not only is the painting in question gone from the site, it has been swiftly purchased, restored, auctioned, and installed in Rome's National Museum. But when the recovered Raphael is just as swiftly destroyed in a fire, Argyll begins to suspect its authenticity\u2026and the innocence of every person in its path.",

        "description": "It's 1895, and the face of Manhattan is rapidly changing. From the electric-lit elegance of Delmonico's Restaurant and Broadway to a netherworld of stifling immigrant tenements, bordellos, and rotgut whiskey, the city simmers in the summer heat. Graft is everywhere-and most of all at 300 Mulberry Street, Metropolitan Police Headquarters, where the men in blue mingle with crooks and corrupt lawyers of every stripe. Here young police detective John \"Dutch\" Tonneman observes firsthand the behind-the-scenes backstabbing between top brass and would-be reformers. But it's a suspicious waterfront blaze and a union rally turned violent that threaten to tear the city apart at the seams. Tonneman arrives on the scene just in time to save a pretty, vivacious young photographer from a vicious assault. Esther Breslau is a lovely Polish Jewish immigrant who worked her way from the sweatshops to a job as a photographer with a crusading newspaper reporter. But when the reporter turns up murdered and Esther's photographic plates are smashed, it's obvious that Esther's pictures were something someone wanted very badly indeed. And now the only living eyewitness to what Esther saw through her camera lens is Esther herself. As the sweltering city reaches the boiling point and a murderer stalks the cobblestoned streets, it's up to Detective Tonneman and Esther to unravel a dangerous mystery whose roots are buried deep in the sordid underbelly of Manhattan-but whose branches may reach to the heights of political power.",

        "description": "I paused, as soon as we reached the pavement, for a look about me. We were evidently in the fashionable quarter of the town. The street was wide, well-kept, and shaded by stately elms. The houses which stretched away on either hand had that spaciousness, that air of dignity and quiet, which bespeaks wealth and leisure. Here was no gaudy architecture, no flamboyant flourish of the newly-rich; rather the evidence of families long-settled in their present surroundings and long-accustomed to the luxuries of a cultured and generous existence. But it was to the house directly before us that I gave the closest scrutiny. It was a large one, two-storied, with a wide veranda running across the entire front. It stood well back from the street, and was sheltered on each side by magnificent trees. The grounds seemed to be very extensive and were beautifully kept. Along the pavement, a curious crowd was loitering, kept in motion by a policeman, but staring at the house as though they expected to read the solution of the mystery in its inexpressive front. Mr. Royce nodded to the officer, and we passed through the gate. As we went up the walk, I noticed that the blinds were closely drawn, as though it were a house of mourning\u2014and, indeed, dead hopes enough lay there! A maid admitted us, and when my companion inquired for Mr. Curtiss, led the way silently along the hall. In the dim light, I could see the decorations of palms and wreaths of smilax, relieved here and there by a mass of gorgeous bloom, and through a door to the right I caught a glimpse of many tables, set ready for the luncheon which was never to be eaten. There was something ghostly about the deserted rooms\u2014something chilling in the thought of this arrested gaiety, these hopes for happiness so rudely shattered. It recalled that vision which had so astonished poor Pip\u2014the vision of Miss Havisham, decked in her yellow wedding finery, sitting at her gilded dressing-table in the darkened room, with the bride-cake cobwebbed and mouldy, and the chairs set ready for the guests who were never to arrive. Only here, I reflected, the clocks should be stopped at noon, not at twenty minutes to nine!",

        "description": "Colwyn had never seen anything quite so eccentric in a public room as the behaviour of the young man breakfasting alone at the alcove table in the bay embrasure, and he became so absorbed in watching him that he permitted his own meal to grow cold, impatiently waving away the waiter who sought with obtrusive obsequiousness to recall his wandering attention by thrusting the menu card before him. To outward seeming the occupant of the alcove table was a good-looking young man, whose clear blue eyes, tanned skin and well-knit frame indicated the truly national product of common sense, cold water, and out-of-door pursuits; of a wholesomely English if not markedly intellectual type, pleasant to look at, and unmistakably of good birth and breeding. When a young man of this description, your fellow guest at a fashionable seaside hotel, who had been in the habit of giving you a courteous nod on his morning journey across the archipelago of snowy-topped tables under the convoy of the head waiter to his own table, comes in to breakfast with shaking hands, flushed face, and passes your table with unseeing eyes, you would probably conclude that he was under the influence of liquor, and in your English way you would severely blame him, not so much for the moral turpitude involved in his excess as for the bad taste, which prompted him to show himself in public in such a condition. If, on reaching his place, the young man's conduct took the additional extravagant form of picking up a table-knife and sticking it into the table in front of him, you would probably enlarge your previous conclusion by admitting the hypotheses of drugs or dementia to account for such remarkable behaviour....",

        "description": "Books 4-6 in Malcolm Archibald's 'Detective Watters Mysteries', a series of crime mystery novels set in 19th century United Kingdom, now in one volume! The Scuttlers: When Sergeant George Watters is assigned to a scuttling case, he thinks he can solve it in a few days. Instead, he discovers a connection to burglaries across Dundee. After one of Watters' informants tells him that someone from the police force is involved, he realizes that the mystery runs deeper than expected. Can Watters solve the case and bring the burglars, and their accomplices, to justice? Not a Pukka Gentleman: Sergeant Watters finds himself overwhelmed with three simultaneous cases. With a case of poisoning, a series of child kidnappings and somebody with a seeming dislike to clocks and watches, Watters and his team are stretched thin. Things get even more complicated when a circus comes to Dundee, and Watters has to help raid an illegal gambling den. Fortunately, Dr. Beaton is there to help. But who is the mysterious man who crosses his path in Dundee, and why would anyone wish to kidnap boys from impoverished backgrounds? A Carriage For Lochee: Already involved in closing down a spate of illegal drinking dens in Lochee and Dundee, Watters is ordered to solve a murder and theft of a carriage from a Lochee merchant. His investigations take him to a family of tinkers and a group of Russian dissidents, as well as back to an incident that occurred in the Crimean War. Together with his partner, Detective Scuddamore, can Watters tie up all the ends in this confusing case?",

Bartley and others,\" which occupied the Probate Court for some weeks on end, and caused an amount of public interest rarely accorded to any but the cases considered in the other division of the same court. The case itself was noted for the large quantity of remarkable and unusual evidence presented by the plaintiff's side\u2014evidence that took the other party completely by surprise, and overthrew their case like a house of cards. The affair will, perhaps, be more readily recalled as the occasion of the sudden rise to eminence in their profession of Messrs. Crellan, Hunt & Crellan, solicitors for the plaintiff\u2014a result due entirely to the wonderful ability shown in this case of building up, apparently out of nothing, a smashing weight of irresistible evidence. That the firm has since maintained\u2014indeed enhanced\u2014the position it then won for itself need scarcely be said here; its name is familiar to everybody. But there are not many of the outside public who know that the credit of the whole performance was primarily due to a young clerk in the employ of Messrs. Crellan, who had been given charge of the seemingly desperate task of collecting evidence in the case....",

The notion of \u201cWeb 2.0\u201d, social software, and social networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter and MySpace have emerged in this context. With such platforms comes the massive provision and storage of personal data that are systematically evaluated, marketed, and used for targeting users with advertising. In a world of global economic competition, economic crisis, and fear of terrorism after 9/11, both corporations and state institutions have a growing interest in accessing this personal data. Here, contributors explore this changing landscape by addressing topics such as commercial data collection by advertising, consumer sites and interactive media; self-disclosure in the social web; surveillance of file-sharers; privacy in the age of the internet; civil watch-surveillance on social networking sites; and networked interactive surveillance in transnational space. This book is a result of a research action launched by the intergovernmental network COST (European Cooperation in Science and Technology).",

With value from micro-level personal networking to macro-level outreach, social networking has become pervasive in people\u2019s lives and is now becoming a significant driving force in business. These new platforms have provided new approaches to many critical enterprise functions, including identifying, communicating, and gathering feedback with customers (e.g., Facebook, Ning); locating expertise (e.g., LinkedIn); providing new communication platforms (e.g., Twitter); and collaborating with a community, small or large (e.g., wikis). However, many organizations have stayed away from potential benefits of social networks because of the significant risks associated with them. This book will help an organization understand the risks present in social networks and provide a framework covering policy, training and technology to address those concerns and mitigate the risks presented to leverage social media in their organization. The book also acknowledges that many organizations have already exposed themselves to more risk than they think from social networking and offers strategies for \"dialing it back\" to retake control. Defines an organization's goals for social networking Presents the risks present in social networking and how to mitigate them Explains how to maintain continuous social networking security",

        "description": "Like any medium of communication social media has its own tropes which must be mastered in order to use it properly. In The Social Media Mind David Amerland illustrates how Social Media is a game changer. It challenges us to rethink our assumptions on almost every sphere where it is applied. Whether communicating through the web with potential clients, increasing the exposure of a business brand or collaborating with colleagues on shared projects, it demands that we rethink the standard responses which have guided us in the past and come up with new ones, for a new age. In carefully laid out arguments, backed by evidence and examples he answers questions like: Why do some social media marketing campaigns fail and not others?Why is social media so radically different from traditional marketing?How are social media success stories created?How can social media help save costs in business?Why is social media changing so many aspects of our world?What does it take to develop a social media mind?Over the next five years social media is going to change the nature of education, politics, business, science and even the arts. Its imperatives for greater transparency, responsiveness and engagement are behind the trends which are changing our world. This book is key to understanding how to prepare, what to do and how.",

        "description": "Web 2.0 is the evolution of the Web towards greater simplicity (requiring no technical knowledge or computer for users) and interactivity (allowing everyone, individually or collectively, to contribute, share and collaborate in various forms). The term \"social media\" is increasingly used and tends to replace the term Web 2.0 and covers the various activities that integrate technology, social interaction, and content creation. Social media uses collective intelligence in a spirit of online collaboration. Social media uses a lot of techniques, such as RSS feeds and other web syndication feeds, blogs, wikis, photo sharing (Flickr), video sharing (YouTube), podcasts, social networks (Facebook ), collaborative bookmarking, mashups, virtual worlds or microblogs (Twitter). A social network is a set of brands, such as individuals or organizations, interconnected by links created during social interactions. It is represented by a structure or a dynamic form of a social group. The analysis of social networks is based on network theory, the use of graphs, and sociological analysis. It is the field that studies social networks. DOI: 10.58679/MM52438",

        "description": "Parents, Children, and Adolescents presents an integrative perspective of the parent-child relationship within several contexts. You can expand your empirical and theoretical knowledge of the parent-child relationship and child development through the book's unusually holistic, theoretical perspective that integrates three main frameworks: interactional theories on parents, children, and development; contextual (ecological) models; and behavior genetics.This insightful book's empirical scope is broader than that of most books in that it considers the parent-child relationship throughout the life course as well as within a great variety of contexts, including interactions with sibling and peers, at school, in their neighborhoods, and with professionals. You'll gain immeasurable knowledge about: parents'child-rearing styles and how they are affected by environmental variables the interaction between parents and children, and between their personalities behavior genetics as one of the explanatory frameworks for the role of genetics and environment negative child outcomes--emotional problems, conduct disorders, and delinquency poverty and other stressors affecting parents and children problematic-abusive, emotionally disturbed, alcoholic parents siblings and peers as contexts for the parent-child dyad the effect of the school system on the family, with a focus on minority families family structure--divorce, remarriage, and families headed by never-married mothers adolescent mothers and their own mothers the psychogenetic limitations on parental influence and cultural roadblocks to parental moral authorityComplete with an Instructor's Manual, Parents, Children, and Adolescents is ideal for advanced undergraduate and graduate classes in family studies and human development, sociology of the family, interdisciplinary developmental psychology, and social work classes that need a thorough perspective on the parent-child relationship. Professionals and scholars in these fields seeking an interdisciplinary framework as well as research suggestions and incisive critiques of traditional perspectives will also find this innovative book a valuable addition to their reading lists.",

        "description": "Recent social trends, including the increased employment of women, the dramatic growth in single-parent households, heightened attention to the aging of the population and to older families, and changing attitudes toward gender roles, guide the focus of this study that considers personal characteristics and family relationships and how they are linked with well-being over the life course. Pat Keith and Robert Schafer discuss how these trends have profoundly affected work/family relationships and how the far-reaching social, demographic, and economic implications of these changes inform some of the vital concerns of particular groups including one and two-job families, single-parent women and their married counterparts, older and younger couples, and modern and traditional spouses. Throughout, the focus is on variation in well-being--self-concept, role strain, and mental health--over the adult life course and the factors that may foster it at various life stages and in different family situations. The study offers observations on persons in different circumstances across the life course that are not often included in the same research but that have produced and will continue to produce lasting changes in the structure of American society. Following two early chapters that set forth the study's guiding concepts, goals, and methodology, Chapters Three through Five assess work and well-being in one- and two-job families and equity in the marriage relationship and examine gender roles in the family, focusing on older families in particular. Typologies of marriages and the self-concept in an intimate relationship are investigated in the next two chapters. The final chapters study gender-role attitudes, characteristics of employment, and well-being of single and married employed mothers; food behavior and diet over the life stages; and families over the life stages. Scholars, students, and researchers in sociology of the family, sex roles, and aging, as well as demographers interested in the consequences of the marital status, will find the insights of this important new study timely and valuable to their work.",

Browning, the dean of modern family studies in theological ethics and practical theology. Scholars probe a number of Browning?'s contributions, particularly his call for an ethic of ?equal regard? within the household and wider society. This book is a true interdisciplinary effort, with insights from psychology, history, law, theology, biology, ethics, feminist theology, childhood studies, and education theory. The Equal-Regard Family and Its Friendly Critics includes seven honorary forewords, ten original essays, and a concluding essay by Don Browning himself.

        "description": "A vigorous call for rethinking the field of business history. Business history needs a shake-up, Philip Scranton and Patrick Fridenson argue, as many businesses go global and cultural contexts become critical. Reimagining Business History prods practitioners to take new approaches to entrepreneurial intentions, company scale, corporate strategies, local infrastructure, employee well-being, use of resources, and long-term environmental consequences. During the past half century, the history of American business became an unusually active and rewarding field of scholarship, partly because of the primacy of postwar American capital, at home and abroad, and the rise of a consumer culture but also because of the theoretical originality of Alfred D. Chandler. In a field long given over to banal company histories and biographies of tycoons, Chandler took the subject seriously enough to ask about the large patterns and causes of corporate success. Chandler and his students found the richest material for theorizing about the course of business history in large companies and their institutional structures and cultures. Meantime, Scranton and others found smaller firms, those specializing in batch work as opposed to mass-produced goods, far closer to the norm and more telling. Scranton and Fridenson believe that the time has come for a sweeping rethinking of the field, its materials, and the kinds of questions its practitioners should be asking. How can this field develop in an age of global markets, growing information technology, and diminishing resources? A transnational collaboration between two senior scholars, Reimagining Business History offers direction in forty-four short, pithy essays.",

In this edited collection of papers, an international range of contributors discuss the fundamental issues faced by the Japanese business and economic system from historical, analytical and empirical perspectives. Their conclusions combine to present a view of the path Japan should take to restore its economy to optimal growth in the 21st century, and show how this path will affect global markets.",

In this book we focus first on Pascal in general and on the application of some simple addition and sorting programs in Dev-Pascal and then dedicate ourselves to a more complex platform that also allows the creation of visual applications with the insertion of Form integrated with the language Pascal, Lazarus. Finally we are dedicated to the design and creation of databases and we integrate them into Lazarus applications. With these notions you will be able to create Pascal programs and applications in Lazarus for the solution of the most varied problems.",

Peters (\u201cPup\u201d), the intrepid tort lawyers whose zany exploits delighted readers of Torts R Us, return with another round of legal shenanigans guaranteed to make you laugh until you cry. Their latest antics include a lawsuit against the Russian government for entrapping a well-known Congressman in a honey trap, attempting to liberate all the chimpanzees in the Bronx Zoo, and representing the unforgettable Lydia Lowlace in lawsuits against unscrupulous strip club owners and video game makers who have taken advantage of her sudden fame. The brothers even concoct a plan to revitalize Connecticut\u2019s three poorest cities by turning them into a mecca for nationwide tort lawsuits. Settle into your favorite chair to make sure you don\u2019t fall on the floor laughing at the latest exploits of these lovable lawyers who will stop at nothing in their pursuit of publicity, fame, fun and money. Critics Lavish Praise on PLEASE PASS THE TORTS \u201cComing on the heels of the hilarious, laugh-out-loud farce TORTS R US, its sequel PLEASE PASS THE TORTS firmly establishes Morrison as the finest writer of humorous fiction since Chaucer. I haven\u2019t laughed so hard since that lady on my show said she thought it was General Lee who was buried in Grant\u2019s Tomb.\u201d - Graucho Marx \u201cHaving laughed my way though PLEASE PASS THE TORTS, I can only ask: Where was Peters and Peters when I needed them during the Cold War? Their solution to Russian spying and dirty tricks is truly awe inspiring. The CIA could have saved tons of money and endless lives if we had just called on the Peters Brothers to solve our problem with the Russkies. \u2013 Allen Dulles \u201cPLEASE PASS THE TORTS is a worthy successor to Morrison\u2019s earlier work, TORTS R US. That book had me laughing hysterically from the first page to the last. It is by far the wittiest work in the English language since I wrote The Importance of Being Earnest.\u201d - Oscar Wilde \u201cHaving laughed my way through TORTS R US and now PLEASE PASS THE TORTS, I can only say that Morrison\u2019s outrageous humor shines through on every page.

        "description": "If you think the term \udbff\udc00low-hanging fruit\udbff\udc01 should describe a soft object that hits you on the head as you walk through an orchard, rather than a business opportunity that is easy to deliver, then you will love this book! How To Get To The Top Without Working Too Hard finally debunks the need for an MBA or any other formal business qualification to progress up the slippery pole to management success. Dick Lannister reveals the strategies and cunning plans that an aspiring executive needs to get to the top but who, crucially, doesn\u2019t want to work too hard to get there. The Master of Corporate Administration (MCA) covers key topics such as finance, marketing, projects and presentations. It\u2019s a course guaranteed to set readers on the path to financial rewards, power and share options, by answering a variety of questions that include: Why do CEOs with a 4-year contract always have 5-year plans? Is a liability a financial metric or a description of the leadership team? How can an inanimate object like a company have corporate values? How To Get To The Top Without Working Too Hard provides a humorous look at the business and professional world. It\u2019s the perfect, light-hearted read for anyone who wants to get to the top... and fast!",

        "description": "The book is intended to provide a definitive view of the field of humor research for both beginning and established scholars in a variety of fields who are developing an interest in humor and need to familiarize themselves with the available body of knowledge. Each chapter of the book is devoted to an important aspect of humor research or to a disciplinary approach to the field, and each is written by the leading expert or emerging scholar in that area. There are two primary motivations for the book. The positive one is to collect and summarize the impressive body of knowledge accumulated in humor research in and around Humor: The International Journal of Humor Research. The negative motivation is to prevent the embarrassment to and from the \"first-timers,\" often established experts in their own field, who venture into humor research without any notion that there already exists a body of knowledge they need to acquire before publishing anything on the subject-unless they are in the business of reinventing the wheel and have serious doubts about its being round! The organization of the book reflects the main groups of scholars participating in the increasingly popular and high-powered humor research movement throughout the world, an 800 to 1,000-strong contingent, and growing. The chapters are organized along the same lines: History, Research Issues, Main Directions, Current Situation, Possible Future, Bibliography-and use the authors' definitive credentials not to promote an individual view, but rather to give the reader a good comprehensive and condensed view of the area.",

        "description": "Most Americans were shocked when Anita Hill charged U.S. Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas with sexual harassment. Not surprisingly, the nation was divided on the Senate hearings on the matter--some believed Hill, others, Thomas. Perhaps the most important result of the hearings was to open the eyes of a majority of the public to the issue of sexual harassment and to begin a dialog on the issue. This work first defines sexual harassment, including operational, sociological and legal definitions, and then provides a history of the issue in the United States and a theoretical framework of why harassment occurs. This is followed by a look at the legal dimension of the problem, with a discussion of pertinent federal and state laws and Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) decisions. The incidence and settings (e.g., workplace, housing, religious institutions) are next examined, followed by chapters on sexual harassment in the government, the military, and in education. The book concludes with discussions of strategies for the victims and for employers.",

        "description": "The nearly 350 humorous, heartwarming, and sometimes tragic accounts presented in William Lynwood Montell\u2019s latest book, Tales from Kentucky Doctors, offer an unusual perspective on the culture and tradition of Kentucky health-care practice. From the laughable to the laudable, Tales from Kentucky Doctors present illuminating portraits of doctors and patients, drawing stories from physicians with lifetimes of experience serving Kentucky families. In chapter 2, doctors recall the successes and failures that shaped their early careers. For Dr. Baretta R. Casey of Hazard, becoming a doctor was a difficult journey. Already married and with a child, Casey enrolled in college at age thirty, later completed medical school, and began a successful career as a family practitioner in the 1990s. Though patient visitations and doctors\u2019 prescriptions are recorded on account ledgers, personal relationships and memories are not part of medical records. The section \u201cPersonal Practice\u201d gives a glimpse of the intimate relationships doctors form with their communities. \u201cI doubt that any individual was nearer to the family than the family doctor,\u201d Dr. W. L. Tyler says in one story. For many towns, family physicians were heroes. Dr. James S. Brashear relates the challenges of practicing in Central City, a coal mining town, recalling an incident in which he saved the lives of two miners. Handed down to Montell in the oral tradition, the tales presented in this collection represent every part of the state. Personal experiences, humorous anecdotes, and local legends make it a fascinating panorama of Kentucky physicians and of the communities they served.",

Humor has been present in American literature, from the beginning, and has developed characteristics that reflect the American character, both regional and national. Although American literature was, in the past, treated as inferior to British literature, there has always been a large popular audience for the genre, which this book shows. The figures with entries in this encyclopedia not only amuse in their writing, but also aim to enlighten- setting out to expose the foibles and foolishness of society and the individuals who compose it. It is the manner in which these authors try to accomplish this end that determines whether they appear in the volume. Indeed, the book will demonstrate that the best humor has at its base, a ready understanding of human nature.",

        "description": "'I love Gretchen Rubin - she helps me understand both myself and the people around me' Cathy Rentzenbrink, 'Obliger' and bestselling author of The Last Act of Love During her investigation to understand human nature, Gretchen Rubin realised that by asking the seemingly dry question 'How do I respond to expectations?' we gain explosive self-knowledge. She discovered that based on their answer, people fit into four Tendencies: Upholders, Questioners, Obligers, and Rebels. Our Tendency shapes every aspect of our behaviour, so using this framework allows us to make better decisions, meet deadlines, suffer less stress, and engage more effectively. More than 800,000 people have taken her online quiz, and managers, doctors, teachers, spouses, and parents already use the framework to help people make significant, lasting change. The Four Tendencies hold practical answers if you've ever thought... - People can rely on me, but I can't rely on myself - How can I help someone to follow good advice? - People say I ask too many questions - How do I work with someone who refuses to do what I ask - or who keeps telling me what to do? With sharp insight, compelling research, and hilarious examples, The Four Tendencies will help you get happier, healthier, more productive, and more creative.

        "description": "In this book, a leading French social thinker grapples with the gap between the tendency toward globalization of economic relations and mass culture and the increasingly sectarian nature of our social identities as members of ethnic, religious, or national groups. Though at first glance, it might seem as if the answer to the question \u0093Can we live together?\u0094 is that we already do live together\u0097watching the same television programs, buying the same clothes, and even using the same language to communicate from one country to another\u0097the author argues that in important ways, we are farther than ever from belonging to the same society or the same culture. Our small societies are not gradually merging into one vast global society; instead, the simultaneously political, territorial, and cultural entities that we once called societies or countries are breaking up before our eyes in the wake of ethnic, political, and religious conflict. The result is that we live together only to the extent that we make the same gestures and use the same objects\u0097we do not communicate with one another in a meaningful way or govern ourselves together. What power can now reconcile a transnational economy with the disturbing reality of introverted communities? The author argues against the idea that all we can do is agree on some social rules of mutual tolerance and respect for personal freedom, and forgo the attempt to forge deeper bonds. He argues instead that we can use a focus on the personal life-project\u0097the construction of an active self or \u0093subject\u0094\u0097ultimately to form meaningful social and political institutions. The book concludes by exploring how social institutions might be retooled to safeguard the development of the personal subject and communication between subjects, and by sketching out what these new social institutions might look like in terms of social relations, politics, and education.",

        "description": "This book addresses the paradox that, despite quantifiable advances, people often struggle to experience positive wellbeing. Kevin Moore argues that two key insights can help resolve this paradox: first, that we live in an \u2018aspirational culture\u2019 that has its roots in the agrarian revolution and now demands constant economic growth, individual ambition, and self-improvement while promoting change and uncertainty; and second, that we are persons, and persons are created when cultures interact with our biology. Accordingly, our wellbeing depends on how personhood develops through that interaction. Bringing together wellbeing and personhood research from multiple disciplines, Moore explains how aspirational cultures are detrimental to wellbeing because they consistently undermine and disrupt the ordinary tasks of life that are essential to sustaining our personhood and wellbeing. He concludes that if we are serious about improving wellbeing, we have to create a culture not based on aspiration but which, instead, focuses on supporting persons and personhood.",

        "description": "The goal of this book is to stimulate an awareness of a person's Authentic Self. For those who would choose to embark or continue on the simple but often difficult path of being better, the author presents a remarkably clear and practical guide that can be of immense benefit to anyone who aspires to grow in living life more fully and authentically. Exercises and suggestions are provided, with special attention directed to a person's inner space where we are encouraged to locate and awaken the neglected or dormant resources present in every human being and apply them in the world. \"Being better\" refers to improvement, but not only at one level. It seems reasonable to focus on three: the material, mental, and transpersonal. These are presented and discussed sequentially, and these concepts should be applied practically in day-to-day life to learn their meaning and value. A series of fifty-nine process activities are included, exploring empirically and experientially the validity that learning and being better are actions, not merely ideas. At each step, these activities consider, refine, and validate notions of who and what we are and how to be better. By increments, we are led to explore and to immerse ourselves fully in life first our own, then the lives of others, and ultimately the source of life itself.",

The novel is written as cultural satire, allegory, and metaphysical treatise, dealing with themes of sincerity, identity, morality, religiosity, economic materialism, irony, and cynicism. Herman Melville's writing draws on his experience at sea as a common sailor, exploration of literature and philosophy, and engagement in the contradictions of American society in a period of rapid change. His best known works include Typee, a romantic account of his experiences in Polynesian life, its sequel Omoo, and the great classic Moby-Dick.",

        "description": "Welcome to the 3 Books To Know series, our idea is to help readers learn about fascinating topics through three essential and relevant books. These carefully selected works can be fiction, non-fiction, historical documents or even biographies. We will always select for you three great works to instigate your mind, this time the topic is: Horatian Satire. - The True-Born Englishman by Daniel Defoe. - The Way We Live Now by Anthony Trollope. - Dead Souls by Nikolai Gogol.Named after the Roman satirist Horace, the Horatian Satire is indulgent, tolerant, amusing and witty. The speaker holds up to gentle ridicule the absurdities and follies of human beings, aiming at producing in the reader not the anger of a Juvenal, but a wry smile. The Devil's Dictionary is a satirical dictionary written by American Civil War soldier, journalist, and writer Ambrose Bierce consisting of common words followed by humorous and satirical definitions. The Way We Live Now is a satirical novel by Anthony Trollope, it was inspired by the financial scandals of the early 1870s. Dead Souls is a novel by Russian author Nikolai Gogol. Along with Gogol's short stories, it is considered a masterpiece. Although it is primarily concerned with Russian society during the early 19th century, Gogol's wit and fresh prose make it a joy to read today. This is one of many books in the series 3 Books To Know. If you liked this book, look for the other titles in the series, we are sure you will like some of the topics.",

        "description": "A sweeping memoir, a raw and intimate chronicle of a young activist torn between conflicting personal longings and political goals. When We Were Outlaws offers a rare view of the life of a radical lesbian during the early cultural struggle for gay rights, Women's Liberation, and the New Left of the 1970s. Brash and ambitious, activist Jeanne C\u00f3rdova is living with one woman and falling in love with another, but her passionate beliefs tell her that her first duty is \"to the revolution\" -to change the world and end discrimination against gays and lesbians. Trying to compartmentalize her sexual life, she becomes an investigative reporter for the famous, underground L.A. Free Press and finds herself involved with covering the Weather Underground, Angela Davis; exposing neo-Nazi bomber Captain Joe Tomassi, and befriending Emily Harris of the Symbionese Liberation Army. At the same time she is creating what will be the center of her revolutionary lesbian world: her own newsmagazine, The Lesbian Tide, destined to become the voice of the national lesbian feminist movement. By turns provocative and daringly honest, Cordova renders emblematic scenes of the era--ranging from strike protests to utopian music festivals, to underground meetings with radical fugitives--with period detail and evocative characters. For those who came of age in the '70s, and for those who weren't around but still ask 'What was it like?' -Outlaws takes you back to re-live it. It also offers insights about ethics, decision making and strategy, still relevant today. With an introduction by renowned lesbian historian Lillian Faderman, When We Were Outlaws paints a vivid portrait of activism and the search for self-identity, set against the turbulent landscape of multiple struggles for social change that swept hundreds of thousands of Americans into the streets.",

It probes the interconnectedness of gay, Jewish and musical subcultures. The book is set against the backdrop of AIDS, when every sexually-active gay man is forced to confront his own mortality. To understand the fear that the disease had touched, the author faces the reality that his own life had been dominated by internalized anti-Semitism. His is the story of confronting the hatred that can result from constant exposure to the hatred of others.",

When their younger son told them in 2004 that he was gay, Sushma was devastated. She wanted to know why this had happened to her family, who was to blame, and what she should do next. To come to terms with her son's sexual orientation, she began to educate herself about homosexuality, a topic that Sushma had no exposure to. She went to counseling and attended PFLAG (Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays) meetings. After much soul searching and many conversations with her son, husband, and others, Sushma accepted her son for who he was. In Loving My Gay Child, Sushma reveals how she came to terms with her son's orientation, shared the news with friends and family, and finally threw a beautiful traditional gay Hindu wedding for her son and his fianc\u00e9.",

        "description": "An emotional, funny, and fabulous memoir by trailblazing and award-winning Trans actor and activist Alexandra Billings. Born in 1962, Alexandra Billings grew up in a decade in which being herself was illegal. When she started transitioning in 1980, the word \"Transgender\" didn't exist. With no Trans role models and no path to follow, Alexandra did what her family, teachers, and even friends said was impossible: Alexandra forged ahead. Spanning five decades, from profound lows to exhilarating highs, This Time for Me captures the events of a pioneering life. An award-winning actor and history-making LGBTQ and HIV/AIDS activist, Alexandra shares not only her own ever-evolving story but also the parallel ways in which queer identity has dramatically changed since the Stonewall riots of 1969. She weaves a true coming-of-age story of richly imaginative lies, of friends being swept away by a plague that decimated the community, of her determination to establish a career that would break boundaries, and of the recognition of her own power. A celebration of endless possibilities, Alexandra's bracing memoir is a fight-to-the-death revolution against all expectations.",

        "description": "\"This book supports my own 30-year crusade to demonstrate that games are an art form that undeniably rivals traditional arts. It gives detailed explanations of game art techniques and their importance, while also highlighting their dependence on artistic aspects of game design and programming.\u201d \u2014 John Romero, co-founder of id Software and CEO of Loot Drop, Inc. \"Solarski\u2019s methodology here is to show us the artistic techniques that every artist should know, and then he transposes them to the realm of video games to show how they should be used to create a far more artful gaming experience ... if I were an artist planning to do video game work, I\u2019d have a copy of this on my shelf.\" \u2014 Marc Mason, Comics Waiting Room Video games are not a revolution in art history, but an evolution. Whether the medium is paper or canvas\u2014or a computer screen\u2014the artist\u2019s challenge is to make something without depth seem like a window into a living, breathing world. Video game art is no different. Drawing Basics and Video Game Art is first to examine the connections between classical art and video games, enabling developers to create more expressive and varied emotional experiences in games. Artist game designer Chris Solarski gives readers a comprehensive introduction to basic and advanced drawing and design skills\u2014light, value, color, anatomy, concept development\u2014as well as detailed instruction for using these methods to design complex characters, worlds, and gameplay experiences. Artwork by the likes of Michelangelo, Titian, and Rubens are studied alongside AAA games like BioShock, Journey, the Mario series, and Portal 2, to demonstrate perpetual theories of depth, composition, movement, artistic anatomy, and expression. Although Drawing Basics and Video Game Art is primarily a practical reference for artists and designers working in the video games industry, it\u2019s equally accessible for those interested to learn about gaming\u2019s future, and potential as an artistic medium.

        "description": "An exploration of the relationship between games and art that examines the ways that both gamemakers and artists create game-based artworks. Games and art have intersected at least since the early twentieth century, as can be seen in the Surrealists' use of Exquisite Corpse and other games, Duchamp's obsession with Chess, and Fluxus event scores and boxes\u2014to name just a few examples. Over the past fifteen years, the synthesis of art and games has clouded for both artists and gamemakers. Contemporary art has drawn on the tool set of videogames, but has not considered them a cultural form with its own conceptual, formal, and experiential affordances. For their part, game developers and players focus on the innate properties of games and the experiences they provide, giving little attention to what it means to create and evaluate fine art. In Works of Game, John Sharp bridges this gap, offering a formal aesthetics of games that encompasses the commonalities and the differences between games and art. Sharp describes three communities of practice and offers case studies for each. \u201cGame Art,\u201d which includes such artists as Julian Oliver, Cory Arcangel, and JODI (Joan Heemskerk and Dirk Paesmans) treats videogames as a form of popular culture from which can be borrowed subject matter, tools, and processes. \u201cArtgames,\u201d created by gamemakers including Jason Rohrer, Brenda Romero, and Jonathan Blow, explore territory usually occupied by poetry, painting, literature, or film. Finally, \u201cArtists' Games\u201d\u2014with artists including Blast Theory, Mary Flanagan, and the collaboration of Nathalie Pozzi and Eric Zimmerman\u2014represents a more synthetic conception of games as an artistic medium. The work of these gamemakers, Sharp suggests, shows that it is possible to create game-based artworks that satisfy the aesthetic and critical values of both the contemporary art and game communities.",

Though \u201csurvival strategy\u201d exists as a defined gaming genre, all video games\u2014as unique, participatory artworks\u2014model both individual and collaborative means of survival through play. Video games offer opportunities to navigate both historical and fictional conflicts, traverse landscapes devastated by climate change or nuclear holocaust, and manage the limited resources of individuals or even whole civilizations on earth and beyond. They offer players a dizzying array of dystopian scenarios in which to build and invent, cooperate with others (through other players, NPCs, or AI) to survive another day. Contributors show how video games focus attention, hone visuospatial skills, and shape cognitive control and physical reflexes and thus have the power to participate in the larger context of radical, activist artworks that challenge destructive hegemonic structures as methods of human conditioning, coping, and creating.",

        "description": "The first analysis of the relationship between art and video games, from the sixties until today. Art and play: how many forms does this relationship take? Duchamp used to say that art was a game and that games were art. When video games joined the dance of the muses this relationship was further enriched. Video games are an art and in recent years they have had a crucial influence on other arts: cinema, literature, music and visual arts. They stand at the crossroads between very diverse forms of culture and product, and it is precisely the anomaly inherent in this encounter/clash that makes them so terribly interesting. Neoludica is an in-depth exploration of the relationship between art and video games, and it underlines how the video game (an interactive multimedia work) is an art form that has yet to be understood by the world of culture. The interactive dimension is a facet that has attracted art since the advent of environmental installations during the sixties, and it is a dimension that has since been developed in digital art through video installations. The video game/art contamination occurs not only on the aesthetic level, but also through those elements of language which can be defined as conceptual, such as interactivity mentioned above. Naturally, it acquires an artistic dimension when its aims go beyond mere technical prowess and explore the world of fantasy.",

Additionally, the book examines areas not normally covered like open source, online research, and peer-to-peer systems. E-Commerce Strategy: Text and Cases is divided into two parts. Part 1 examines the evolution of e-commerce, analyzes different sectors such as B2B and m-Commerce, and explores the challenges they face. Case studies of well known companies reinforce the concepts learned to demonstrate both successes and failures in the field. Part 2 deals with developing strategies in e-Commerce and looks at future trends including Web 2.0.

        "description": "After the dramatic failures of the dot coms in 2000 and 2001, many observers were quick to report on the death of electronic commerce. Investor confidence sagged, stock prices of technology firms in nearly all of the related sectors suffered. In reality, the picture is not nearly as dismal as the press would have us believe. E-commerce is not dead, but it has moved beyond its overhyped beginning stage. This book is an effort to sort through the hype, providing a realistic assessment of the state of electronic commerce today, and the important areas of opportunity and challenge for tomorrow. The book sees all kind of developments where e-business is becoming an integral part of \u2018traditional\u2019 business processes, with special emphasis on practical and policy importance. E-commerce scholars from a number of disciplines and countries contribute to assess the impact of the dot com bust and the current state of e-commerce.",

Governments are reviewing the rules of usage for consumer data in marketing and advertising in order to take advantage of the huge economic opportunity that the data driven economy represents. Companies, recognizing the opportunity, are hurrying to adapt by digitalizing their processes. They are putting pressure on their managers and working teams to learn how to make best use of the technology capabilities and their data resources. What is more, premier national companies have to compete in a global business field where their Silicon Valley-breed competitors have a substantial advantage in terms of digitalization and data usage. Written in plain English with illustrative examples and cases, this book is for the general manager who seeks a better grasp of this fast-changing business world and a better understanding of what will be required from he/she, not just now but in five years' time.",

The internet eliminates the temporal and spatial constraints on the exchange of information. It changes deeply the world of production and of labour. It transforms the exchange relationships between producers and consumers as well as between the suppliers within the supply-chain. The electronic economy is able to generate more accurate con sumer profiles and, therefore, a more powerful and effective marketing di rected to the individual consumer. There is no industry that is not undergoing thorough changes caused by the internet. The volume at hand gives an analysis of the internet revolution. It covers questions reaching form the highly controversial thesis of the end of property rights in the internet caused by the non-rivalry of the \"consumption\" of in formation to questions regarding the repercussions of the internet on our understanding of the human person. Technological changes like the introduction of the electronic economy pose the question of how to handle it and how to manage reasonably its ethi cal problems and dilemmas. The ethical problems and the business ethics of the electronic economy in the fields of production and labour, of consump tion, and in handling trust and the abuse of trust are analysed by the contribu tions from applied ethics and business ethics.",

        "description": "The three coeditors knew John Butterworth for many years and had worked closely with him on a number of research projects. We respected him as a valuable colleague and friend. We were greatly saddened by his untimely death. This book is an attempt to remember him. We dedicate the volume to John with thanks for the contributions he made to our research, to the Faculty of Commerce and Business Administration at the University of British Columbia, and to the accounting profession. This volume contains twelve invited papers on the general topic of the economic theory of information and contracts. We asked leading scholars who had known John to contribute papers. The response was very gratifying. The authors provided us with new strong research papers that should make a lasting contribution to the accounting and information economics research literature, and make us all proud to have put this volume together. The research papers in the volume are in three sections: information evaluation in multi person conte)l:ts; contracting in agencies under moral hazard; and contracting in agencies with private information. We begin part I with Jerry Feltham's review of John Butterworth's pioneering contributions to the accounting and information economics literature. This is followed by an introduction to the papers in the volume and the papers themselves.",

The work offers detail about the effects of China\u2019s economic reforms on management control in Chinese enterprises and insightful comparisons with Western theory and Western examples. Readers will discover important themes and the evolution of theory in MCS, including discussions of frameworks and the links between management control and economics, management, accounting, cybernetics and system theory. Early chapters explore management control in Chinese enterprises during the period, especially the demands of (guidance, enforcement and external regulation) and the demand for (stakeholders, managers, investors) management control. The work moves on to explore Western management control theory and research, including an examination of the evolution of internal control theory. The author presents detailed perspectives on the elements of management control systems and introduces masterful new ideas and methods through four general control models and ten critical elements in the management control process. A view of management control in various different types of enterprise is presented, from special enterprises and small to medium enterprises to non-profit organizations. The standards for enterprise management control are explored. This work is a valuable practical guide for corporate management teams who wish to develop and execute their own internal control strategies. It will also provide foreign researchers, policy-makers and practitioners with a new perspective on Chinese management control experiences.",

        "description": "This book focuses on market mechanisms which protect quality in the provision of audit services. The role of public regulation is thus situated in the context defmed by the presence of these safeguard mechanisms. The book aims to contribute to a better understanding of these market mechanisms, which helps in defining the con tent of rules and the function of regulatory bodies in facilitating and strengthening the protective operation of the market. An analysis at a more general level is provided in the three chapters making up Part 1. In the four chapters of Part 2, on the other hand, this analysis is applied to a particular problem to determine how those non-audit services often provided by auditors to their audit clients should be regulated. Finally, Chapter 8 contains a summary of the analysis and conclusions of the work. The conclusion with regard to non-audit services is that their provision generates beneficial effects in terms of costs, technical competence, professional judgment and competition and, moreover, need not prejudice auditor independence or the quality of these services. This as sessment leads, in the normative sphere, to recommending a legislative policy aimed at facilitating the development and use of safeguards provided by the free action of market forces. Regulation should thus aim to enable the parties-audit firms, self-regulatory bodies and audit clients-to discover through competitive market interaction both the most efficient mix of services and the corresponding quality safeguards, adjusting for the costs and benefits of each possibility.",

        "description": "The musical, whether on stage or screen, is undoubtedly one of the most recognizable musical genres, yet one of the most perplexing. What are its defining features? How does it negotiate multiple socio-cultural-economic spaces? Is it a popular tradition? Is it a commercial enterprise? Is it a sophisticated cultural product and signifier? This research guide includes more than 1,400 annotated entries related to the genre as it appears on stage and screen. It includes reference works, monographs, articles, anthologies, and websites related to the musical. Separate sections are devoted to sub-genres (such as operetta and megamusical), non-English language musical genres in the U.S., traditions outside the U.S., individual shows, creators, performers, and performance. The second edition reflects the notable increase in musical theater scholarship since 2000. In addition to printed materials, it includes multimedia and electronic resources.",

        "description": "The Wizard of Oz, Gigi, Top Hat, High Society - some of the most popular movie musicals ever made were written by Broadway songwriters. The Sound of Music, Chicago, West Side Story, The Music Man, Grease - some of the other most popular movie musicals were adaptations of Broadway shows. From the very first talkies to the present, Broadway's composers and lyricists have given much of their best work to the movies - but with varying results. In the 1930s, Rodgers and Hart's Love Me Tonight, with Maurice Chevalier and Jeanette MacDonald at their sexiest, is a masterpiece of fairytale sophistication. But Hallelujah, I'm a Bum, an Al Jolson vehicle about tramps in Central Park, is one of the outstanding flops, partly because Rodgers and Hart wrote it as a kind of opera that is spoken instead of sung. Or take the big films based on Broadway shows in the 1960s. After The Sound of Music, Hollywood sought to fill the screen with lots of scenery, lots of drama, and lots of Julie Andrews. But Camelot and Hello, Dolly! had too much scenery, Paint Your Wagon was the hippie musical, and Song of Norway was simply loony. Even Julie Andrews couldn't save the Broadway bio film called Star!, all about the adventures of Gertrude Lawrence.",

        "description": "Hollywood Musicals offers an insightful account of a genre that was once a mainstay of twentieth-century film production and continues to draw audiences today. What is a film musical? How do musicals work, formally and culturally? Why have they endured since the introduction of sound in the late 1920s? What makes them more than glittery surfaces or escapist fare? In answering such questions, this guidebook by Steven Cohan takes new and familiar viewers on a tour of Hollywood musicals. Chapters discuss definitions of the genre, its long history, different modes of analyzing it, the great stars of the classic era, and auteur directors. Highlights include extended discussions of such celebrated musicals from the studio era as The Love Parade, Top Hat, Holiday Inn, Stormy Weather, The Gang's All Here, Meet Me in St. Louis, Cover Girl, Mother Wore Tights, Singin' in the Rain, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, The Band Wagon, Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, and Jailhouse Rock as well as later films such as Cabaret, All that Jazz, Beauty and the Beast, and La La Land. Cohan brings in numerous other examples that amplify and extend to the present day his claims about the musical, its generic coherence and flexibility, its long and distinguished history, its special appeal, and its cultural significance. Clear and accessible, this guide provides students of film and culture with a succinct but substantial overview that provides both analysis and intersectional context to one of Hollywood's most beloved genres.",

        "description": "From the favorites of Tin Pan Alley to today\u2019s international blockbusters, the stylistic range required of a musical theatre performer is expansive. Musical theatre roles require the ability to adapt to a panoply of characters and vocal styles. By breaking down these styles and exploring the output of the great composers, Songwriters of the American Musical Theatre offers singers and performers an essential guide to the modern musical. Composers from Gilbert and Sullivan and Irving Berlin to Alain Boublil and Andrew Lloyd Webber are examined through a brief biography, a stylistic overview, and a comprehensive song list with notes on suitable voice types and further reading. This volume runs the gamut of modern musical theatre, from English light opera through the American Golden Age, up to the \"mega musicals\" of the late Twentieth Century, giving today\u2019s students and performers an indispensable survey of their craft.",

Musical practices have evolved as composers and musical directors inherited from the past and innovated with new technology; different interpretations of single plays in multiple iterations have provided a picture of developing styles, genres, working practices, technologies and contexts; actor musicianship has been practiced quietly and without fuss; and the role of the sound designer has appeared and transformed the theatrical soundscape. This book moves to musical theatre to evidence a continuum between its rich interdisciplinary textures and the musicodramatic world of Shakespeare\u2019s plays, positioning the RSC as an innovative company that continually expands the creative and collaborative possibilities of the theatre.",

At the same time, we remark that theoretical and empirical research in emerging stock markets has been particularly challenged by their fast changes in nature and size under the effects of financial liberalization and reforms. This evolving feature has particularly led to a commensurate increase in sophistication of modeling techniques used for understanding financial markets. In this spirit, the book aims at providing the audience a comprehensive understanding of emerging stock markets in various aspects using modern financial econometric methods. It addresses the empirical techniques needed by economic agents to analyze the dynamics of these markets and illustrates how they can be applied to the actual data. On the other hand, it presents and discusses new research findings and their implications.",

It is not only an exercise in comparative economic history but it also relates these institutions to wider world markets, thereby clarifying their functions and how they related to the general financial and economic framework. Students and researchers in economic and social history will welcome the reissue of this groundbreaking account of two historically important institutions in a crucial period of their development. Financial practitioners and others will also find much of interest here, in terms of both fascinating history and of insights into an era when a global market was rapidly evolving largely free of the twentieth-century distortions and hindrances introduced by wars, interventionist governments and exchange controls.",

        "description": "\"While the state-preference approach is perhaps more general than the mean variance approach and provides an elegant framework for investigating theo retical issues, it is unfortunately difficult to give it empirical content. \" I The state of the art in asset pricing has substantially changed over the past years. While the seminal CAPM represents an equilibrium model derived under rather restrictive assumptions on preferences or return distributions and places a lot of emphasis on the efficiency of a somehow arbitrary market portfolio, subsequent models were much less restrictive with respect to the underlying economic struc ture. For example, the arbitrage pricing theory maintains the linear relationship between risk and return simply by assuming the absence of arbitrage profits. While empirically more tractable than the CAPM, the main drawback of arbitrage pricing models is that they do not provide much insight into the economic and dynamic nature of risk premia. The \"conditional\" CAPM provides an elegant econometric framework to characterize how changing economic conditions de termine the variability of multiple risk premia. However, this framework still re quires some rather ad-hoc assumptions about the economic nature of the pricing kernel. An ingenious next step in asset pricing modeling was therefore to revert the question to be addressed. Instead of placing strong restrictions on distribu tions and preferences, observed returns are used to derive restrictions which must be imposed on the stochastic properties of the pricing kernel. A simple Euler-type equation is typically used to characterize that approach.",

The study isolates different phases of crisis and differentiates between any crisis that remains confined to the region and those that take up a global dimension. The latent structure of the global stock market, the inter-regional and intra-regional stock market dynamics around the crises are analyzed to get a complete picture of the structure of the global stock market. The study further probing into the inherent nature of the global stock market in generating crisis finds the global market to be chaotic thus making the system intrinsically unstable or at best to follow knife-edge stability. The findings have significant bearing at theoretical level and on policy decisions.",

It provides a brief history and institutional discussion of these investment companies and also presents a summary of the research on these funds. Investment practitioners will find the book useful as a reference and as a quick refresher on the current state of knowledge regarding each fund type. Equally important, it provides academic researchers with an accurate institutional framework within which to cast their theoretical models, and a point of departure for expanding the empirical analysis for improving our understanding of these funds. All-in-all, this is a very valuable book; I highly recommend it.\" (John J. Jackson, Professor of Economics, Auburn University) \"Professors Anderson, Born, and Schnusenberg provide a valuable service in this monograph. The practical significance of closed-end funds, exchange-traded funds, and hedge funds has increased dramatically in recent years, but all too many academics and investors know little about them. This text presents a carefully-focused and understandable description of these investment vehicles, highlighting the big, unresolved questions, while also including careful and fair accounts of the state of the literature. Nothing extraneous clutters the presentation, but, more importantly, nothing necessary is left out. Highly recommended.\" (T. Randolph Beard, Professor of Economics and Public Policy, Auburn University) \"This book is both useful as a reference book and as an additive, educational overview of ETFs and hedge funds, as well as CEFs. In today\u2019s tumultuous markets, much reference is made to these subjects without a clear understanding of the vehicles, their structure and their history. This is a very timely publication and should be viewed as an important read. The book contains definitive explanations and also includes an excellent summary of past works in this area.

Among the most striking developments are the expanded stockholder base, the increased popularity of mutual funds among households, and the growing importance of private pension funds. Developments in Europe mirror to a large extent the spread of equity culture in the United States, but with lower levels of involvement and interesting differences across European countries. This book, intended for a wide audience of students, practitioners, and policy makers, provides the theoretical and methodological background necessary for analysis of stockholding behaviour, and presents empirical studies that use the most comprehensive household-level databases to identify determinants of stockholding in five major European countries.",

It offers a broad examination of the attributes and development of the ETF markets. The book presents a new approach to ETF markets modeling that uses innovation diffusion model. In addition, it explores the empirical links between ETFs and Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs). The book also compares ETFs and competing investment options. This book should appeal to both academics and practitioners as it includes detailed descriptions of the ETF markets and prepared projections regarding their future development. As the Asia-Pacific region plays a significant role in the global economy, this book should be useful for international readers beyond this area. The Emergence of ETFs in Asia-Pacific begins with an overview of the Asia-Pacific economies, focusing on their importance for the global economy and their features. Next, the book introduces an analytical framework. It explains major features of ETFs (such as their creation, distribution, and trading) and key categories, which facilitates profound understanding of the book merit even for readers with little knowledge about ETFs. The following chapter explores the role of ICTs in economy and society identifying channels of their impact on financial markets. It discusses how ICTs foster dynamic spread of financial innovations (including ETFs) across financial markets. Next, the book examines the ETF market's development in different countries in the Asia-Pacific region, by analyzing their level of development in terms of turnover. In this part it also provides brief characteristics of all markets, including their structures and categories of ETFs in various countries. Consecutive part of the book is dedicated to reports on the process of ICTs growing penetration across Asia-Pacific countries, showing the changes observed during recent years. It then continues the empirical analysis of the ETF markets in the Asia-Pacific region by attempting to trace the links between the development of ETF markets and ICT penetration during the period 2004-2017. As complementary material, a methodological annex is included showing major analytical techniques used throughout the research.",

        "description": "Welcome to the 3 Books To Know series, our idea is to help readers learn about fascinating topics through three essential and relevant books. These carefully selected works can be fiction, non-fiction, historical documents or even biographies. We will always select for you three great works to instigate your mind, this time the topic is: Coming of Age - Great Expectations by Charles Dickens - The Waves by Virginia Woolf - Little Women by Louisa May AlcottGreat Expectations is the thirteenth novel by Charles Dickens and his penultimate completed novel: a bildungsroman that depicts the personal growth and personal development of an orphan nicknamed Pip. Great Expectations is full of extreme imagery\u2014poverty, prison ships and chains, and fights to the death \u2014 and has a colourful cast of characters who have entered popular culture. The Waves is a 1931 novel by Virginia Woolf. It is considered her most experimental work, and consists of soliloquies spoken by the book's six characters: Bernard, Susan, Rhoda, Neville, Jinny, and Louis. Also important is Percival, the seventh character, though readers never hear him speak in his own voice. The soliloquies that span the characters' lives are broken up by nine brief third-person interludes detailing a coastal scene at varying stages in a day from sunrise to sunset. Little Women is a novel by U.S. author Louisa May Alcott, which was originally published in two volumes in 1868 and 1869. Following the lives of the four March sisters\u2014Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy\u2014the novel details their passage from childhood to womanhood and is loosely based on the author and her three sisters. This is one of many books in the series 3 Books To Know. If you liked this book, look for the other titles in the series, we are sure you will like some of the topics.",

The fact that he was an orphan was living proof. Steph had a few golden rules he abided by: stay true to himself and his friends and to follow his plan. The plan was simple: graduate high school, attend college, and take care of his grandmother. However, as is often true, things don\u2019t always go according to plan. As summer vacation looms closer, Steph\u2019s life begins to head toward a path that will change him forever. It will leave him with a critical choice to make. Will he remain disciplined, focused, and committed to seeing his plan come to fruition? Or will he let the drama of jealous guys around the way, relationship pressure, and newfound uncertainty cloud his destiny? 1",

The teenager is popular among his peers, but he has terrible grades, and his family life at home is not going well. Plus, Max has a huge secret he is keeping from the world. Max is gay. Recently he has chosen a pen-pal from a candidate list for English class as his grades have been growing increasingly bad. With the youngster's standards slipping, and with the need to get ahead, Max decides to take the last resort. Reluctantly, the boy writes a letter and sends it off to an anonymous person to whom he has been assigned. When the reply comes back, Max learns that the other sender is also a boy within the same school. Over two months, the teenagers grow a bond through a lost art of communication, helping Max to come to terms with who he is, and to Max's amazement, he's fallen for an unknown boy who sounds perfect in every way according to their correspondences.",

All, and more, are tumbled into this story of a nearly-grown boy confronting the challenges of coming of age. It is a story that will ring clearly in the minds of young readers-male and female-as they too face the pains and joys of transition out of their teenage years. And as he struggles, adult readers will also be reminded of their similar challenges of growing into adulthood. Truthfully, regardless of age, we all are continually \"coming of age\" and face new obstacles and pleasures in this passageway of getting older. David's story is one that readers of all ages can identify with-to enjoy and contemplate.",

        "description": "In 1877, Maximilienne Carpentier died after being shipwrecked off the Danish coast. Emilie Carpentier, however, survived the tragedy, and suddenly this diminutive cousin of the enigmatic Max finds herself thrust center-stage as the drama surrounding her mid-Atlantic island and its potential for evil unfolds. But Emilie's troubles aren't only external. Forced to this out-of-the-way place by circumstances beyond her control, she meets duty more than she can bear, temptation greater than she ever envisaged, and hope more fulfilling than any that has yet entered her life. From a dread of personal relationships to the fear of fear itself, this young woman finds herself coming of age in every aspect as she sways between raw physical passion and deep emotional insight. Answering the need for a sequel to The Islander, the author now gives us rare insight into the mind-and heart-of a woman.",

        "description": "This carefully edited collection has been designed and formatted to the highest digital standards and adjusted for readability on all devices. Louisa May Alcott (1832 - 1888) was an American novelist best known as author of the novel Little Women, Good Wives and the sequels Little Men and Jo's Boys. The first part of Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy (1868), is a semi-autobiographical account of her childhood with her sisters in Concord, Massachusetts. Part two, or Part Second, also known as Good Wives (1869), followed the March sisters into adulthood and their respective marriages. Little Men (1871) detailed Jo's life at the Plumfield School that she founded with her husband Professor Bhaer at the conclusion of Part Two of Little Women. And Jo's Boys (1886) completed the \"March Family Saga\". Alcott made women's rights integral to her stories, and her fiction became her \"most important feminist contribution\u201d \u2014 even considering all the efforts Alcott made to help facilitate women's rights during her lifetime.",

This is a story of two young people driving away from the Rock-like locus of Youth, while still retaining part of Youth's Golden Vision in their rearview mirrors (and dashboard Sun visor). This is a story that concerns the Search for God and Self, which one finds, at the end of the Odyssey, are All One in the same sacred place. This is a cautionary tale that concerns America's Sunday-morning's-everyday-for-all-I-care youths, and their quick, cynical, unfulfilling, and inevitable descent into solipsistic/nihilistic adulthood. This is a story that reminds that Youth (and, perhaps, America) is a bildungsroman that must topple before being reborn. This is a bittersweet, tragic comedy of Transformation, in which the changes in Maynard and Seamus mirror a coming cultural Revolution. This is a story of Truth planted firm - born of Fire, surrounded by Water and spread by Air.

David's is supposed to be looking for a job, but Dawn has the week off and is determined to work on her tan. Distracted David finds himself increasingly tempted by their seductive foreign exchange student, who makes it very clear what she wants. In spite of the Study Abroad program's strict policy against fraternizing, Dawn's teasing ways slowly break down the barrier between them until they both give in to their lust. But what are they going to do about the feelings that have developed between them in the meantime? NOTE: Previously titled Foreign Exchange, this is a slightly less naughty, but no less sexy re-telling--updated and redressed for your reading pleasure. EXCERPT: \"David?\" I woke up with a grunt, hearing my name being hissed from beside the bed. It was dark, but I could make out her outline in the moonlight coming through the window. She was on her hands and knees, crawling toward me. \"Dawn?\" I felt her find the bed with a thud. \"Ow.\" She whimpered. \"Christ!\" I reached for her, groping in the dark. My hand found her arm, helping her up into the bed. \"What are you doing?\" \"Ta,\" she said, thanking me. I could smell the alcohol on her now. \"It's a long way when you're legless.\" \"Shhhh!\" I looked toward my door. I was listening for my Mum or Dad but didn't hear them. \"C'mon, let's get you to bed.\" \"That's where I am.\" She crawled up against me in the dark and pressed me down, snuggling up against my bare chest. \"Hey, you sleep naked! When did you start that?\" \"Since I was fourteen,\" I whispered. \"Keep your voice down, Dawn.\" \"I am.\" She kissed my shoulder. \"You feel good.\" \"Okay.\" I tried to untangle her limbs from mine. \"You are pretty well lashed, and I think this is a bad idea. C'mon, let's go.\" \"Noooo!\" She slid her bare foot up the inside of my calf. She'd lost her heels somewhere, I noticed, but I could feel the skirt and blouse pressed against me, her body full and warm underneath, flushed from the alcohol. \"Don't make me go.\" \"I think you'd better.\" I tried to sit, but she was clinging to me too tightly. \"I'll scream,\" she whispered into my ear, her breath hot against my neck. \"You will not.\" I edged my way out from under her. I heard her intake of breath and knew she really meant to do it. What was wrong with her? Panicked, I rolled onto her, finding her mouth with my hand in the dark and pressing it there, hard. \"Button it!\" I hissed, feeling her wiggling and squirming underneath me. Her skirt was riding high up and I felt her bare thighs against mine, her skin like velvet. \"Unbutton it,\" she murmured when I moved my hand away from her mouth, her fingers working her blouse from top to bottom between us.

This book examines the new challenge in which firms receive sustainable funding that is in alignment with the company\u2019s spending capacity. The purpose of this book is to examine the main theoretical issues and practices regarding entrepreneurship and finance and their impact on performance, innovation and economic growth. It analyzes the fundamental aspects of entrepreneurship and studies ways in which financial institutions can better fulfill their primary function of feeding capital to businesses and the economy as a whole. Entrepreneurship and finance are fundamental to achieving success in economic and social activities. SMEs\u2019 existence and development depend on the initiatives of entrepreneurship and access to resources, especially those of a financial nature. During the recent economic crisis, several new financing instruments have appeared, especially with structures designed for helping SMEs make their way out of the recession. This book explores some of these tools in various global economies, such as France and Spain, providing an international, multidimensional perspective.",

        "description": "The ping-pong diplomacy and its aftermath discussion, coupled with the entry of communist China into the United Nations and the subsequent expulsion of Taiwan, will generate considerable political dialogue about the changing balance of power and the fate of the other China. These political discussions will obviously overshadow the true role and function of the existence of Taiwan. Given the time, Taiwan could become a model for the development process for other emerging countries. Taiwan's experience with eco nomic development has real relevance for many countries. For exam ple, in less than two decades Taiwan has achieved the industrial and economic growth that should well make it the envy of nearly all other developing nations. Its per capita income is exceeded only by Japan among the countries of the Far East. Yet, despite vigorous economic and industrial growth, obvious breakdowns in this economic progress come into view. The lack of managerial input threatens to become a real bottleneck. The study reported in this volume examines the feasibility and utility of transferring advanced management know-how and practices into the industrial enterprises in Taiwan in order to generate further economic and industrial growth. The study itself concerns management practices and effectiveness of American subsidiaries, Japanese sub sidiaries, and comparable local firms in Taiwan.",

The essays comprise contributions on various microeconomic and macroeconomic policy angles that are crucial for a less developed economy to embark on a road to recovery to converge with the desired trajectory. The topics encompass a broad range of issues like the role of savings, capital formation, human capital, innovations, entrepreneurship, profit-shifting by multinational corporations, small and medium enterprises (SMEs), and firms\u2019 strategies for achieving sustained and balanced growth. The chapters are organized under three major themes based on the commonality of areas that they cover: (i) Macroeconomic Constraints: Monetary Policy, Investments, and Population; (ii) Firms\u2019 Performance, SMEs, and Role of Entrepreneurship; and (iii) Entrepreneurship and Business Performance: Strategies and Policies. It has a collection of 12 empirical studies that have an overall focus on macroeconomic policies such as savings among the rural poor; sustained investments in and development of capital markets; role of entrepreneurial sustainability; role of innovations for firms\u2019 performance; healthcare reforms; the benefits of technology, policy incentives such as tax benefits for promoting growth, and strategic considerations such as marketing or positioning strategies; export strategies; and productivity enhancement via processing and profit sharing. With contributions from 27 authors, the studies bring forth knowledge about the factors that influence well-being via better technologies and innovations favoring productivity, firm performance, and their positive externalities in the food, nutrition, and health sectors. Given the wide-ranging coverage of top-down and bottom-up approaches and strategies for development, the book offers insights for policy interventions necessary for Rwanda\u2019s gradual transition from agriculture to an industrial transformation via manufacturing and service-led development without smokestack industries.",

        "description": "This book locates Robeson's extraordinary accomplishments in the tumultuous events of twentieth-century history. Paul Robeson was, at points in his life, an actor, singer, football player, political activist and writer, one of the most diversely talented members of the Harlem Renaissance. Swindall centers Robeson's story around the argument that while Robeson leaned toward Socialism, a Pan-African perspective is fundamental to understanding his life as an artist and political advocate. Many previous works on Robeson have focused primarily on his involvement with the US Communist Party, paying little attention to the broader African influences on his politics and art. With each chapter focused on a decade of his life, this book affords us a fresh look at his story, and the ways in which the struggles, successes and studies of his formative years came to shape him as an artist, activist and man later on. --Cover.",

        "description": "Arthur Ashe explains how this iconic African American tennis player overcame racial and class barriers to reach the top of the tennis world in the 1960s and 1970s. But more important, it follows Ashe\u2019s evolution as an activist who had to contend with the shift from civil rights to Black Power. Off the court, and in the arena of international politics, Ashe positioned himself at the center of the black freedom movement, negotiating the poles of black nationalism and assimilation into white society. Fiercely independent and protective of his public image, he navigated the thin line between conservatives and liberals, reactionaries and radicals, the sports establishment and the black cause. Eric Allen Hall\u2019s work examines Ashe\u2019s life as a struggle against adversity but also a negotiation between the comforts\u2014perhaps requirements\u2014of tennis-star status and the felt obligation to protest the discriminatory barriers the white world constructed to keep black people \"in their place.\" Drawing on coverage of Ashe\u2019s athletic career and social activism in domestic and international publications, archives including the Ashe Papers, and a variety of published memoirs and interviews, Hall has created an intimate, nuanced portrait of a great athlete who stood at the crossroads of sports and equal justice. \"Hall\u2019s elegant and well-paced narrative teases out the contradictions of one of tennis\u2019s most enigmatic characters.\"\u2014Times Literary Supplement \"A strong book on an outstanding topic, it serves as a reminder that Ashe's tragic death has to some extent eclipsed his life's work on behalf of racial equality.\"\u2014Wall Street Journal \"A portrait of Arthur Ashe that shows the fullness of his character\u2014his broad interests, his impressive talents, and his missteps.\"\u2014New Books in Sports \"A remarkable book that will serve as a model for future works in this genre.\"\u2014Virginia Magazine of History and Biography Eric Allen Hall is an assistant professor of history at Georgia Southern University, Statesboro.",

        "description": "As the executive director of Freedom House for twenty-one years and now its Senior Scholar in International Communications, Leonard R. Sussman has had the extraordinary opportunity of both leading and serving an organization that has been at the center of the struggle for freedom for more than sixty years. Founded by Eleanor Roosevelt, Wendell Willkie, and other visionary Americans, both Democratic and Republican, Freedom House has championed worthy causes from the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s, to the new democracies that have emerged around the world since the 1990s. In this engrossing memoir of his adventures with courageous men and women in fifty-nine countries, Sussman pays tribute to those mostly unsung heroes who contributed to freedom and humanistic ideals and in some cases paid the heavy price of imprisonment, torture, or death. Among the many interesting individuals profiled are: Helen Suzman, a white parliamentarian who fought apartheid for three decades; Milovan Djilas, a leading Yugoslav anticommunist who suffered years of imprisonment; philosopher-activist Sidney Hook; Luis Munoz Marin, Puerto Rica's first elected native governor; Lucia Thorne, a courageous journalist who risked her life in Afghanistan during the Soviet invasion; and many other journalists, politicians, activists, and intellectuals. Also included is a never-before-published 1987 interview with civil rights leader Bayard Rustin, in which Rustin compares the NAACP's Roy Wilkins with Martin Luther King. This one-of-a-kind memoir, full of intriguing insights and vignettes, is a fascinating record of people, ideas, and history in the making.",

        "description": "One of the most famous political activists of all time, Emma Goldman was also infamous for her radical anarchist views and her \"scandalous\" personal life. In public, Goldman was a firebrand, confidently agitating for labor reform, anarchism, birth control, and women's independence. But behind closed doors she was more vulnerable, especially when it came to the love of her life. This is more than an account of Goldman's legendary career as a political activist -- it offers an intimate look into her affair with Chicago activist and red-light district gynecologist Ben Reitman. As it charts her twin passions for Reitman and for social reform, it provides new insights into a brilliant, complex woman. The result is both a riveting love story and a primer on an exciting, explosive era in American politics and intellectual life.",

Its outcomes are based on lessons learned from the software engineering crisis which started in the 1960s. The book presents a systematic approach to overcome the crisis in software engineering depends which not only depends on technology-related but also on human-related factors. It proposes an adaptive methodology for software product development, which optimizes the software product lifecycle in order to avoid \u201clocal\u201d crises of software production. The general lifecycle pattern and its stages are discussed, and their impact on the time and budget of the software product development is analyzed. The book identifies key advantages and disadvantages for various models selected and concludes that there is no \u201csilver bullet\u201d, or universal model, which suits all software products equally well. It approaches software architecture in terms of process, data and system perspectives and proposes an incremental methodology for crisis-agile development of large-scale, distributed heterogeneous applications. The book introduces a number of specialized approaches which are widely used in industry but are often ignored in general writings because of their vendor-specificity. In doing so, the book builds a helpful bridge from academic conceptions of software engineering to the world of software engineering practice. With its systematic coverage of different software engineering methodologies and the presented rich systems engineering examples the book will be beneficial for a broader audience.",

The focus is on the presentation of rigorous step-by-step approaches for modeling flexible agricultural and environmental systems, starting with a conceptual diagram representing elements of the system and their relationships. Furthermore, diagrams such as sequential and collaboration diagrams are used to explain the dynamic and static aspects of the software system. This second edition includes: a new chapter on Object Constraint Language (OCL), a new section dedicated to the Model-VIEW-Controller (MVC) design pattern, new chapters presenting details of two MDA-based tools \u2013 the Virtual Enterprise and Olivia Nova and a new chapter with exercises on conceptual modeling. It may be highly useful to undergraduate and graduate students as the first edition has proven to be a useful supplementary textbook for courses in mathematical programming in agriculture, ecology, information technology, agricultural operations research methods, agronomy and soil science and applied mathematical modeling. The book has broad appeal for anyone involved in software development projects in agriculture and to researchers in general who are interested in modeling complex systems. From the reviews of the first edition: \"The book will be useful for those interested in gaining a quick understanding of current software development techniques and how they are applied in practice... this is a good introductory text on the application of OOAD, UML and design patters to the creation of agricultural systems. It is technically sound and well written.\" \u2014Computing Reviews, September 2006",

        "description": "Collaboration among individuals \u2013 from users to developers \u2013 is central to modern software engineering. It takes many forms: joint activity to solve common problems, negotiation to resolve conflicts, creation of shared definitions, and both social and technical perspectives impacting all software development activity. The difficulties of collaboration are also well documented. The grand challenge is not only to ensure that developers in a team deliver effectively as individuals, but that the whole team delivers more than just the sum of its parts. The editors of this book have assembled an impressive selection of authors, who have contributed to an authoritative body of work tackling a wide range of issues in the field of collaborative software engineering. The resulting volume is divided into four parts, preceded by a general editorial chapter providing a more detailed review of the domain of collaborative software engineering. Part 1 is on \"Characterizing Collaborative Software Engineering\", Part 2 examines various \"Tools and Techniques\", Part 3 addresses organizational issues, and finally Part 4 contains four examples of \"Emerging Issues in Collaborative Software Engineering\". As a result, this book delivers a comprehensive state-of-the-art overview and empirical results for researchers in academia and industry in areas like software process management, empirical software engineering, and global software development. Practitioners working in this area will also appreciate the detailed descriptions and reports which can often be used as guidelines to improve their daily work.",

        "description": "Evolution of software has long been recognized as one of the most problematic and challenging areas in the field of software engineering, as evidenced by the high, often up to 60-80%, life-cycle costs attributed to this activity over the life of a software system. Studies of software evolution are central to the understanding and practice of software development. Yet it has received relatively little attention in the field of software engineering. This book focuses on topics aimed at giving a scientific insight into the aspect of software evolution and feedback. In summary, the book covers conceptual, phenomenological, empirical, technological and theoretical aspects of the field of software evolution - with contributions from the leading experts. This book delivers an up-to-date scientific understanding of what software evolution is, to show why it is inevitable for real world applications, and it demonstrates the role of feedback in software development and maintenance. The book also addresses some of the phenomenological and technological underpinnings and includes rules and guidelines for increased software evolvability and, in general, sustainability of the evolution process. Software Evolution and Feedback provides a long overdue, scientific focus on software evolution and the role of feedback in the software process, making this the indispensable guide for all software practitioners, researchers and managers in the software industry.",

        "description": "Emotions, reputations, relationships -- so many aspects of social and organizational life today are subject to quantification and other calculative practices. Calculation develops due to a demand for control and accountability. Money is one such instrument of calculation, and the foremost. As a unit of account and means of payment, it serves the purpose of exchange. Yet, money has itself increasingly become an object of calculation and exchange on financial markets tending less to the production and exchange of real goods than the elimination of uncertainty by means of exchangeability. Has the economy therefore lost its measure? The essays collected in Money and Calculation investigate, from various viewpoints, how calculation and money bear upon the meaning of measure in contemporary economic life. They will excite and give much pause for thought to economists, sociologists, and all who have an interest in the meaning of life in our globalized world.",

        "description": "What Lemonade Stand Economics will do... Give students a plan to pay for college without needing student loans. Sitting in the financial aid office at freshman orientation is not the time to start planning how you are going to pay for college. The best way to avoid student loan debt is to never sign the loan papers in the first place. In order to do that you need a plan. Lemonade Stand Economics is that plan. Educate students in financial literacy. Financial literacy standards are written right into Lemonade Stand Economics making it useful in the classroom. High schools introduce students to the basics of money management, but Lemonade Stand Economics takes it to another level by teaching students the importance of planning for their financial future, budgeting, setting financial goals and how debt impacts them after graduation. Teach students skills that will benefit them for the rest of their lives regardless of where their career path takes them. Even more important than the money students make working for themselves, is the real world education they receive. Time management, money management, how to market yourself, workplace etiquette, overcoming fear and handling rejection along with the importance of budgeting and the pain of debt. Real issues that are better learned during high school then after college. Paying for college is easier than you think Lemonade Stand Economics teaches high school students how to work for themselves and graduate from college without student loans. Learn to make $15, $20 or even $50 per hour working for yourself and pay for college one semester at a time. It's not hard if you know what to do, but that's the problem. As a high school student you just don't know where to start. Lemonade Stand Economics shows you what you do... and where to start. There is a problem in America - some say an epidemic - called student loan debt. High school students want to attend college but most don't have the money set aside to pay for it. Most take out student loans for four years, graduate, and start off their adult life in debt. Often times starting their adult lives with massive debt. These students are not stupid or lazy, in fact they are quite smart and energetic, but they don't know where to start or what to do to earn enough money to pay for college. They don't need that job slapping sandwiches together for minimum wage and going home smelling like bologna and pickles. That's not going to pay for college! The typical college student graduates with $26,000 in student loans. The typical college graduate takes over 17 years to pay off their student loans. You don't have to be typical! With a good plan you can pay for college without student loans or money from your parents. Lemonade Stand Economics will teach you how to set goals, budget, advertise, market, price jobs, and serve up a steamin' hot plate of fantastic customer service. Once in this money making rhythm you will make enough to pay for college and graduate with no debt. Let your little brother run the lemonade stand now, it's time to make some real money.",

        "description": "Readers of science fiction dystopia comedy books who also like portal fantasy will (hopefully) enjoy the dry sarcastic humour and satire of this series. There are dark sections and some gallows humour, but this is, for the most part, a light sci fi novel. A man chosen by destiny. The wrong man. Meet The Pan of Hamgee: coward, unwilling adventurer and, by some miracle, K\u2019Barth\u2019s longest surviving outlaw. He just wants a quiet life so working as getaway driver is probably a bad career move. Then he falls in love at first sight with a woman he hasn't even met who comes from an alternative reality. That\u2019s when things really begin to get complicated. Meet Ruth Cochrane: she\u2019s the Chosen One, destined to play a pivotal role in saving K\u2019Barth from a cruel dictator. She\u2019s never heard of K\u2019Barth, though. She\u2019s a public relations executive from London and she\u2019s totally unaware of the chaos about to hit her life. Meet Lord Vernon: power hungry psychopath on the brink of world domination. He wants to cement his hold on K'Barth by kidnapping the Chosen One and forcing her to marry him. Only one person is standing in his way: someone who doesn\u2019t even realise it, The Pan of Hamgee. For The Pan, and Ruth, that\u2019s a deadly problem. Written in British English with some light swearing. There is dark stuff in here but any readers who have read all the Harry Potter books without any worries should be OK with this series. Suggested cinema rating, PG: first novel in a complete science fiction/fantasy series of 4 books Runner up in 2011 Wishing Shelf Awards Awarded Awesome Indies Seal of Approval Awarded IndiePENdents seal of approval. Few Are Chosen is the first book in the K'Barthan Series of dystopian humorous science fiction books. It is set in a contemporary dystopia, in a parallel reality but there is some futuristic technology. This book ends in a cliff hanger and for full enjoyment readers are strongly advised to read the series in order, continuing the story with The Wrong Stuff, K'Barthan Series: Part 2 (green cover) after reading this one. **** INTERVIEW WITH THE AUTHOR Q \u2013 What made you write this series? A \u2013 If you want the honest answer I wrote it for me. As a reader, I love British satire and humor (or humour). I love wit; funny epic fantasy series like the Discworld novels and comedic sci fi like Douglas Adams. I like sff and speculative fiction, I like adventure and action and a gripping tale that zips along quickly, I like genre mash ups and I love an angsty dystopian world. However, the best science fiction and fantasy stories, for me, are funny. I aim to write comedy in the tradition of all the great humorous British authors. I like to aim high. I wanted protagonists people could love and empathise with, mavericks, misfit characters, real people ... except they're not all people obviously, some of them are other alien (ish) species. This book is about misfit heroes and heroines winning the day, it\u2019s about good versus evil even when the good guys are on different sides. It's dystopian science fiction fantasy action - it's dystopia but it's comedy, it's sci-fi but it's planet-based. You'll find all sorts of quirky characters and interesting alien species: from 6ft Swamp Things with antennae to cute furry creatures like the Blurpons, with their fluffy ears, big button eyes and penchant for extreme violence. Oh ... and did I mention the flying car chases? Q \u2013 Do our readers have to read the K\u2019Barthan Series in order? A \u2013 Yes otherwise the character development \u2013 and some of the technology \u2013 will make less sense the books go in this order: - Unlucky Dip, K'Barthan Series: Prequel ** - Few Are Chosen, K'Barthan Series: Part 1 - this book ** - The Wrong Stuff, K'Barthan Series: Part 2 - One Man: No Plan, K'Barthan Series: Part 3 - Looking For Trouble, K'Barthan Series: Part 4 **** SIMILAR AUTHORS: Robert Rankin, C Gockel, Patty Jansen, JJ Greene, FJ Savage, Heide Goodey, EM Foner, Robert Asprin, the Stainless Steel Rat and Space Team series.

        "description": "The Pan of Hamgee is not a natural knight in shining armour. Yet he has escaped from police custody in K\u2019Barth, switched realities and foiled Lord Vernon\u2019s attempt to kidnap Ruth, the Chosen One, from the Festival Hall. Pretty good, he thinks. However, Ruth thinks otherwise. Being pursued by Lord Vernon is bad enough. Now, thanks to The Pan, she\u2019s on the run. They are both alive, of course, but with Lord Vernon on their tail neither of them can be sure how long for. To save K'Barth and Ruth, the woman of his dreams, The Pan must introduce her to the Candidate, who is prophesied to be the man of her dreams. And he must do it fast \u2013 before Lord Vernon finds her. But the gentleman in question is in hiding and no-one knows where. Only The Pan can find him, if he can bring himself to unite them. Written in British English with a dash of light swearing. Suggested cinema rating PG. A QUICK WORD WITH THE AUTHOR Q - So, tell us about the K\u2019Barthan Series. What made you write it? What makes it special? A - As a reader, I have always loved British satire and humor or humour. I love comedic sci fi and fantasy and I love funny; funny epic fantasy series like the Discworld novels and comedic sci fi like Douglas Adams totally floats my boat. But I also like a gripping tale that zips along quickly in the time honoured tradition of unputdownable adventure. And of course, I like genre fiction mashups; Douglas Adams meets StarTrek and James Bond - and a dash of romance (but no squelchy bits). Therefore, my cunning gambit was fantasy that was also science fiction and would surprise even me. I wanted a fast paced story and gripping tale but comedy in the tradition of all the great funny British authors. The K'Barthan series does have a deeper side. Sure on one level it's a light piece of witty comedy fiction but on another level it's about teamwork; team action in science fiction - or fantasy. Our heros and heroines work together across the series to bring down the indomitable forces of evil (bit of an untrendy epic fantasy trope there but I like it). You won't find standard mythic creatures in my sci fi - I couldn't face the deluge of emails I'd inevitably get from those who knew more about them than I do, telling me I'd got them wrong. However, you will find all sorts of quirky characters and interesting alien species. From six feet Swamp Things with antennae to cute furry creatures like the Blurpons, with their fluffy ears, big button eyes and penchant for extreme violence. The K\u2019Barthan population has variety. Q \u2013 Should this series be read in order? A \u2013 Yes. The character development \u2013 and some of the technology \u2013 will make the most sense if it is. That said, the short series prequel can be read any time. The books go in this order: - Unlucky Dip: Prequel - Few Are Chosen, K\u2019Barthan Series: Part 1 - The Wrong Stuff, K\u2019Barthan Series: Part 2 - One Man: No Plan, K\u2019Barthan Series: Part 3 - Looking For Trouble, K\u2019Barthan Series: Part 4 Q \u2013 What is your favourite kind of Book? Would The K'Barthan Series fit on the list? A \u2013 Oh yes. I wrote it entirely for me. If anyone else likes it, that\u2019s gravy. I love British humour, especially satire and parody in sci fi and fantasy: people like Pratchett and Adams. There\u2019s so much texture and depth in their books. I think if you're funny you can be harder hitting and setting it all in a parallel reality helps. Q \u2013 Do you have a target reader? A \u2013 It's more a mind set and an approach to life I'm reaching out to. Sure, I wrote it with my (then) teenage nephew in mind - but to give you an idea; the oldest fan of the series I know of is in his 90s and the youngest is 10. Q \u2013 Thanks for giving our readers a look inside The K'Barthan Series. A \u2013 Thank you!",

Despite the dystopian setting, and the odd bit of gallows humour, it's a light sci fi novel. When The Pan of Hamgee encounters some mudlarkers trying to land a box on the banks of the River Dang he is happy to help. Having accepted a share of the contents as a reward he cannot believe his luck. It contains one of the most expensive delicacies available in K\u2019Barth, Goojan spiced sausage. If he can sell it, the sausage might spell the end of his troubles. On the other hand, knowing his luck, it could bring a whole load more. Written in British English with a dash of light swearing.

        "description": "Readers of science fiction dystopia comedy books will (hopefully) enjoy the dry sarcastic humour of this series. Despite the dystopian setting these books are up-beat. Terry Pratchett meets Dr Who ... sort of. As recently appointed delivery man for Big Merv, one of Ning Dang Po's most powerful crime bosses, The Pan of Hamgee is ordered to deliver a gift to Big Merv's current girlfriend. With a pair of bespoke-made, sapphire and diamond earrings on board, and a trip across the city in the offing, what could possibly go wrong? Everything. This book is written and spelled in Britsh English, suggested cinema rating PG. Contains moderate violence (a comedy punch up) and a dash of light swearing. Suitable for any reader of any age from 10 up - younger readers who have read all the Harry Potter books without any worries will be fine with the Hamgeean Misfit stories. Close Enough is the third book in the Hamgeen Misfit, dystopian humorous science fiction series. It is set in a contemporary dystopia, in a parallel reality but there is some futuristic technology. There is an overall story arc, but these funny comedy stories are written to be stand alone and can be read in any order. **** INTERVIEW WITH THE AUTHOR Q \u2013 What made you write this series? A \u2013 If you want the honest answer I wrote it for me. As a reader, I love British satire and humor (or humour). I love wit; funny epic fantasy series like the Discworld novels and comedic sci fi like Douglas Adams. I like sff and speculative fiction, I like adventure and action and a gripping tale that zips along quickly, I like genre mash ups and I love an angsty dystopian world but the best science fiction and fantasy stories, for me, are funny. I am to write comedy in the tradition of all the great humorous British authors. I like to aim high. I wanted protagonists people could love and empathise with, mavericks, misfit characters, real people ... except they're not all people obviously, some of them are other alien (ish) species. This book is about misfit heroes and heroines winning the day, it\u2019s about good versus evil even when the good guys are on different sides. It's dystopian science fiction fantasy action - it's dystopia but it's comedy, it's sci-fi but it's planet-based. You'll find all sorts of quirky characters and interesting alien species: from 6ft Swamp Things with antennae to cute furry creatures like the Blurpons, with their fluffy ears, big button eyes and penchant for extreme violence. Oh, and there's this debrief scene ... *** SIMILAR AUTHORS: Robert Rankin, C Gockel, Patty Jansen, JJ Greene, FJ Savage, Heide Goodey, EM Foner, Robert Asprin, the Stainless Steel Rat and Space Team series.

When Hal and Clunk set out to make a fresh start, this wasn't exactly what they had in mind. Now Hal must choose: take on the rival to save his own business, or help the officer with her first - and possibly last - investigation? Whatever he decides, it's No Free Lunch for Hal Spacejock! Set in the distant future, where humanity spans the galaxy and robots are second-class citizens, No Free Lunch is the fourth novel in the Hal Spacejock series. Book five, Baker's Dough, is also available. Winner, Western Australian Science Fiction Foundation Award, 2008 One of five finalists in the 2008 Aurealis Awards Australia's Premier Speculative Fiction award One of six finalists in the 2008 Ditmar Awards Also available in Hal Spacejock Omnibus Two, along with books five and six in the series. This is usually the cheapest way to pick up all three novels. Hal Spacejock novels are self-contained, with a beginning, a middle and a proper ending. They're not sequels, they don't end on a cliffhanger, and you could start or end your journey with any book in the series. (Some events from earlier books are referenced in later ones, so it makes sense to read them in order, but it's not essential.)

When crash landing onto a planet filled with flying, fire-breathing beasts, Daniel is uncertain he can step up as the captain his crew needs to escape the strange planet. Daniel is an Unwanted. His parents didn't want him. The Space Academy didn't want him. The shipyard he worked at for years barely wanted him. But here he was, clawing through the ranks of them all to become the captain of his very own ship. The Ghost. After one successful accidental mission, and a second mediocre one, he is now the captain of an exploratory crew. To go where no one has gone before, and all that jazz. It's always been his dream. But when he crash lands on a planet full of dragons. No, not dinosaurs. Dragons. Yes, you heard that right. Dragons. Fire-breathing, Ice-Breathing, and lots of other elemental-breathing, flying dragons. Daniel doesn't know what to do. They may not be intelligent life, but he's stranded with a small crew and they must fight their way out, fix their ship, and get as far away from what Daniel is calling \"Dragon Planet\" (Original--I know), and onto his next exploratory mission ... if he can survive. If you love Star Trek and The Orville, Science Fiction with snarky characters and humor-filled plot lines with a little bit of hard science, then you\u2019ll love Ghost Dragon, because everyone is an explorer at heart!

        "description": "Murder, money, mystery, and metaphysics come together in a collection of riveting alternative-history thrillers. The Menmenet mysteries take place in a very different San Francisco colonized by the Egyptian Empire. A city of fog, temples, and mystery, Menmenet and the country of which it is the capital, the Ta'an-Imenty Republic, sit in an uneasy tension with the First Peoples' nations and the United States to the East. They get along well enough with the Aztec Republic to the south, but the Russians from Russkaya Amerika to the north are a constant source of trouble. Shesmu za-Akhen is a celebrity chef in Menmenet. Hutyt-er-Semetyu Cheryl MacIntyre is an emigrant from Boston in the United States trying to make her way in the homicide squad of the Menmenet medjau, the enforcers of ma'at. The trilogy of novels in the Menmenet Series tells their story. The Jackal of Inpu tells the story of how Shesmu and MacIntyre met, a romantic mystery full of murder and misplaced religiosity. In the second novel, The Lion of Bastet, the lovers follow the money amidst Aztec and Russian gangsters and temple priests dead set against them. The novel combines romance, police procedure, and religious conflict in a murder mystery that comes to a stunning conclusion. The third novel, The Bull of Mentju, takes Shesmu and MacIntyre far out of their comfort zones. Shesmu confronts the mystery of his missing father in the high mountains to the east, encountering First Peoples shamans and their gods, while MacIntyre confronts a more prosaic problem: the United States is mounting a secret attempt to take over the small country with genocidal intent. Ancient gods and modern armies clash in this military and political thriller. Enjoy all three novels in this box set of alternate history mysteries.",

        "description": "ALTERNATE HISTORY FROM A MASTER. Best known for his genre-defining Ring of Fire novels, Flint continues his alternate look at Jacksonian America in 1824: The Arkansas War. The relocation of the southern Indian tribes to Oklahoma engineered by Sam Houston following the War of 1812 also swept up many black inhabitants of North America. Many of the states in the USA\u2014free as well as slaveholding\u2014have passed laws ordering the expulsion of black freedmen. Having nowhere else to go, they joined the migration of the southern Indian tribes and settled in Arkansas. What results by 1824 is a hybrid nation of Indians, black people, and a number of white settlers as well. The situation is intolerable for the slaveholding states, which find a champion in Speaker of the House Henry Clay, whose longstanding ambition to become President of the United States looks to be coming to fruition. But Sam Houston and his friends and allies \u2014the freedman Charles Ball, a former gunner for the US Navy and now a general in the Arkansas army, and the Irish revolutionary Patrick Driscol\u2014are building a powerful army of their own in Arkansas. The crisis is brought to a head by the election of 1824. The war that follows will be a bloody crisis of conscience, politics, economics, and military action, drawing in players from as far away as England. And for such men as outgoing president James Monroe, Secretary of State John Quincy Adams, charismatic war hero Andrew Jackson, and the violent abolitionist John Brown, it is a time to change history itself.

        "description": "In a very different San Francisco, a detective and her chef partner follow the money amidst gangsters and temple priests dead set against them finding it. Cheryl MacIntyre aids her friend Henutsenu when the Temple of Bastet arrests her for sacrilegious murder. But in Menmenet, the temples outrank the cops. The frustrated MacIntyre puts her own life in danger as she recklessly dives into the middle of a gang war between the local Aztec mob and encroaching Russian mafias from Russkaya Amerika. Shesmu wins the Best New Chef award from the Menmenet R\u2019ames Society. When he tries to collect his award check, he discovers a vast swindle. The con sucks in an old family friend, and Shesmu seeks to help. Then Henet Baket revenue agents step in to accuse Shesmu himself of tax evasion and money laundering. The two cases merge as MacIntyre and Shesmu follow the money. Then things turn dire. Russian gangsters bomb Shesmu\u2019s restaurant. An Aztec crime lord insists MacIntyre help him fend off encroachment by mafias from Russkaya Amerika. Then the Temple of Bastet threatens to execute Henutsenu. Staying out of jail shifts to survival when gangsters, money-laundering tycoons, and corrupt police stage attacks on the pair to obstruct their pursuit of ma\u2019at. The second novel in the Menmenet trilogy of alternate history mysteries, The Lion of Bastet tells a story of corruption and murder in Menmenet, the capital city of the Ta\u2019an-Imenty Republic, a country on the West Coast of North America colonized by the Egyptian Empire in the 18th century.",

        "description": "The impossible has spawned the unthinkable. In 2021, a quantum military experiment goes horrifically wrong. A multinational taskforce of ultra-modern warships is suddenly transported back in time to 1942... right into the path of the US naval battle group bound for Midway Atoll. History is rewritten in an instant as the future smashes into the past, and high-tech hardware goes head to head with World War Two technology. In the chaos that ensues, thousands are killed, but the maelstrom has only just begun. The veterans of Pearl Harbour have never seen a helicopter, or a cruise missile - let alone nanotechnology, ceramic bullets, and F22 Raptor stealth jetfighters. Allied and Axis forces are then caught in a desperate struggle to gain the upper hand - each hoping to tip the balance with a fist full of twenty first century firepower. What happens next is anybody's guess - and everybody's nightmare...",

        "description": "Drawing on theories of historiography, memory, and diaspora, as well as from existing genre studies, this book explores why contemporary writers are so fascinated with history. Pei-chen Liao considers how fiction contributes to the making and remaking of the transnational history of the U.S. by thinking beyond and before 9/11, investigating how the dynamics of memory, as well as the emergent present, influences readers\u2019 reception of historical fiction and alternate history fiction and their interpretation of the past. Set against the historical backdrop of WWII, the Vietnam War, and the War on Terror, the novels under discussion tell Jewish, Japanese, white American, African, Muslim, and Native Americans\u2019 stories of trauma and survival. As a means to transmit memories of past events, these novels demonstrate how multidirectional memory can be not only collective but connective, as exemplified by the echoes that post-9/11 readers hear between different histories of violence that the novels chronicle, as well as between the past and the present.",

        "description": "Although separated from the modern reader by a full century, the First World War continues to generate controversy and interest as the great event upon which modern history pivoted. Not only did the war cull the European peoples of some of their best and brightest, it also led to the destruction of the Austro-Hungarian, German, Ottoman and Russian empires, and paved the way for the Second World War. This thought-provoking book explores ten alternate scenarios in which the course of the war is changed forever. How would the war have changed had the Germans not attacked France but turned their main thrust against Russia; had the Greeks joined the allies at Gallipoli; or had the British severed the communications of the Ottoman Empire at Alexandretta? What if there was a more decisive outcome at Jutland; if the alternative plans for the Battle of the Somme in 1916 had been put into effect; or if the Americans intervened in 1915, rather 1917? Expertly written by leading military historians, this is a compelling and credible look at what might have been.",

        "description": "By the author of breakout WW II era alternate history Himmler\u0090s War and Rising Sun, a compelling alternate history thriller. After winning WW I, Germany invades America in 1920, marching through California and Texas as a desperate nation resists. Consider another 1920: Imperial Germany has become the most powerful nation in the world. In 1914, she had crushed England, France, and Russia in a war that was short but entirely devastating. By 1920, Kaiser Wilhelm II is looking for new lands to devour. The United States is fast becoming an economic super-power and the only nation that can conceivably threaten Germany. The U.S. is militarily inept, however, and is led by a sick and delusional president who wanted to avoid war at any price. Thus, Germany is able to ship a huge army to Mexico to support a puppet government. Her real goal: the invasion and permanent conquest of California and Texas. America desperately resists as the mightiest and most brutal army in the world in a battle fought on land, at sea, and in the air as enemy armies savagely marched up on California, and move north towards a second Battle of the Alamo. Only the indomitable spirit of freedom can answer the Kaiser's challenge. At the publisher's request, this title is sold without DRM (Digital Rights Management).",

You must forget your limits. It was only when Phil Knight got cut from the baseball team as a high school freshman that his mother suggested he try out for track instead. Knight made the track team and he found he could run fast and even more he liked it. Ten years later, young and searching, Knight borrowed fifty dollars from his father and launched a company with one simple mission: import high-quality running shoes from Japan. Selling the shoes from the boot of his car to start, he and his gang of friends and runners built one of the most successful brands ever. Phil Knight encountered risks and setbacks along the way, but always followed his own advice. Just keep going. Don't stop. Whatever comes up, don't stop. Filled with wisdom, humanity, humour and heart, the young readers edition of the bestselling Shoe Dog is a story of determination that inspires all who read it. This is an abridged edition of the internationally bestselling adult book, but in addition it includes new frontmatter and backmatter, an introduction to the younger reader and 'A Letter to the Young Reader' that provides advice from Phil Knight for the battles that lie ahead for young people.",

Walter Isaacson tells the story of the rollercoaster life and searingly intense personality of creative entrepreneur whose passion for perfection and ferocious drive revolutionized six industries: personal computers, animated movies,music, phones, tablet computing, and digital publishing. Although Jobs cooperated with this book, he asked for no control over what was written, nor even the right to read it before it was published. He put nothing off limits. He encouraged the people he knew to speak honestly. And Jobs speaks candidly, sometimes brutally so, about the people he worked with and competed against. His friends, foes, and colleagues provide an unvarnished view of the passions, perfectionism, obsessions, artistry, devilry, and compulsion for control that shaped his approach to business and the innovative products that resulted.",

        "description": "Howard Schultz was born and raised in the Canarsie Housing Projects in Brooklyn, New York, the child of a fractured family--his father a bitter truck driver put out of work by an injury, his mother an optimist with dark secrets. Howard hid in the concrete stairwells at night, while his parents turned their apartment into a den of illegal activity, serving the local population of gambler and drinkers. By day he learned the hard lessons of the project playgrounds, as well as the consolations of a working-class community's spirit. He also learned what it meant to be on the wrong side of the American dream--and his own dream was to create a company that would take care of workers like his father, instead of discarding them, and bring people together instead of profiting from their isolation. But soon his ambitions grew even beyond that. This is the story of how Schultz did it, from the business trip to Milan as a young salesman that set him on fire with the idea of creating an American third place, to the struggles and reversals that marked the early, uncertain days of Starbucks, to Howard's encounters with baristas, managers, and customers around the country that transformed his sense of what Starbucks needed to become. He also tells the dramatic stories of a succession of major Starbucks initiatives that arose from this vision: the company's early, controversial expansion of benefits to same-sex couples; their push to create a fund to support small, local entrepreneurs during the depths of the recession; hiring programs for veterans and refugees; support for workers with undocumented relatives; initiatives around race and police violence; programs to raise starting wages, offer benefits to part-time employees, and provide free college to all staff. Throughout these compelling stories is a manifesto about the ethical obligations of powerful businesses in a time of radical inequality and dysfunctional government--and the responsibility we all have to prioritize our shared humanity over the destructive, mindless, and heartless incentives of capitalism.",

        "description": "This book adopts the decision theoretic viewpoint in the organization design problems in management and organization theory. The first part considers a short-run adaptive process in the organization. The organization design is represented by a combination of the organization structure and the management system and constitutes a part of the sequential decision problem of the work. The second part considers the long-run adaptive process for modifying and improving the work. This process is formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process. The final part restates the theoretical results of the previous two parts as normative propositions on the efficient organization design. To test these propositions, the study focusses on the organization structures and the management systems of Japanese firms and obtains the data which support the author's theoretical propositions. This book provides a useful normative approach to organization design problems in management and organization theory.",

        "description": "Why do some organizations learn at faster rates than others? Why do organizations \"forget\"? Could productivity gains acquired in one part of an organization be transferred to another? These are among the questions addressed in Organizational Learning: Creating, Retaining and Transferring Knowledge. Since its original publication in 1999, this book has set the standard for research and analysis in the field. This fully updated and expanded edition showcases the most current research and insights, featuring a new chapter that provides a theoretical framework for analyzing organizational learning and presents evidence about how the organizational context affects learning processes and outcomes. Drawing from a wide array of studies across the spectrum of management, economics, sociology, and psychology, Organizational Learning explores the dynamics of learning curves in organizations, with particular emphasis on how individuals and groups generate, share, reinforce, and sometimes forget knowledge. With an increased emphasis on service organizations, including healthcare, Linda Argote demonstrates that organizations vary dramatically in the rates at which they learn\u2014with profound implications for productivity, performance, and managerial and strategic decision making.",

        "description": "This edited volume focuses on the interplay between organizational identities and firm growth, an area which remains largely unexplored. Firm growth in its various forms is omnipresent in the contemporary business environment, but does not always lead to positive results. At the same time, some organizations are growing faster than their peers, leading to questions of organizational growth antecedents. In addition to the dominant economic reasons in strategic literature, the volume seeks to integrate psychological aspects to the discourse, thereby considering the micro, meso and macro level. By providing both insights into international academic thinking and into practical examples of small and medium-sized companies in Berlin, the authors identify new findings concerning successful growth strategies.",

These studies span multiple levels of analysis and draws on a range of disciplines, including strategic management, economics, and economic geography. Managing Decline: A Research Overview provides a summary of this research by focusing on three key levels of analysis: industries, clusters, and organizations. The targeted reviews in this book map each individual level of analysis separately and the discussion section outlines overarching themes regarding decline and its management. The three levels are analysed by identifying different forms, causes, processes, and management options regarding decline. This is accompanied by the identification of key academic discourses that have been used to analyse decline. The discussion section highlights broader themes regarding the nature and management of decline that span across the different levels of analysis. This book provides an easy to access summary on the nature and management of decline for academic scholars and business practitioners, and is essential reading for getting an overview of this broad field of research\"--",

        "description": "Business Education in Emerging Market Economies discusses the impact of business education on emerging markets and explores curricular innovation, pedagogical approaches, and strategic alliances in the context of industrializing economies. Emerging markets contain 80% of the world's population and some 75% of its trade growth in the foreseeable future, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce. The potential economic growth of these emerging markets has prompted a need to understand their dynamics, business institutions and educational systems. Many American universities, for example, have responded to the demand of their students and business partners by educating them about the exciting opportunities and lurking threats in these industrializing economies. This book contains multiple chapters designed to educate American students about the curricular innovations and course development occurring in emerging markets.",

While some businesses in Asia have been swift to embrace the new normal, others have found the disruption to the traditional way of doing business challenging. Businesses are striving to respond, adapt, and thrive under the shadow of the unprecedented upheaval to the business environment that has forced them to rethink their strategies, processes, and operating models. There seems to be a consensus among business scholars and stakeholders that the continuous embrace of change and transformation of business models will assist businesses to sustain a long-term competitive advantage. The chapters in this book explore shifts in business innovation and strategies linked to the \u201cnew normal\u201d of doing business during the pandemic, bringing to light issues, challenges, and opportunities that firms can expect to face in their need to ensure sustainability post-pandemic and beyond.",

Readers will learn the essentials of financial statements and terminology, the stock market, public companies, and more--all with an eye on how this knowledge helps them do their jobs better as communication professionals.",

        "description": "The nineteenth century introduced developments in science and medicine that made the eradication of pain conceivable for the first time. This new understanding of pain brought with it a complex set of moral and philosophical dilemmas. If pain serves no obvious purpose, how do we reconcile its existence with a well-ordered universe? Examining how writers of the day engaged with such questions, Victorian Pain offers a compelling new literary and philosophical history of modern pain. Rachel Ablow provides close readings of novelists Charlotte Bront\u00eb and Thomas Hardy and political and natural philosophers John Stuart Mill, Harriet Martineau, and Charles Darwin, as well as a variety of medical, scientific, and popular writers of the Victorian age. She explores how discussions of pain served as investigations into the status of persons and the nature and parameters of social life. No longer conceivable as divine trial or punishment, pain in the nineteenth century came to seem instead like a historical accident suggesting little or nothing about the individual who suffers. A landmark study of Victorian literature and the history of pain, Victorian Pain shows how these writers came to see pain as a social as well as a personal problem. Rather than simply self-evident to the sufferer and unknowable to anyone else, pain was also understood to be produced between persons\u2014and even, perhaps, by the fictions they read.",

The Yankov characteristic formulas have become a very useful tool in propositional, modal and algebraic logic. The papers contributed to this book provide the new results on different generalizations and applications of characteristic formulas in propositional, modal and algebraic logics. In particular, an exposition of Yankov\u2019s results and their applications in algebraic logic, the theory of admissible rules and refutation systems is included in the book. In addition, the reader can find the studies on splitting and join-splitting in intermediate propositional logics that are based on Yankov-type formulas which are closely related to canonical formulas, and the study of properties of predicate extensions of non-classical propositional logics. The book also contains an exposition of Yankov\u2019s revolutionary approach to constructive proof theory. The editors also include Yankov\u2019s contributions to history and philosophy of mathematics and foundations of mathematics, as well as an examination of his original interpretation of history of Greek philosophy and mathematics.",

        "description": "Two simple yet tremendously powerful ideas that shaped virtually every aspect of civilization This book is a breathtaking examination of the two greatest ideas in human history. The first is the idea that the human mind can grasp the universe. The second is the idea that the human mind can grasp itself. Acclaimed philosopher Linda Zagzebski shows how the first unleashed a cultural awakening that swept across the world in the first millennium BCE, giving birth to philosophy, mathematics, science, and virtually all the major world religions. It dominated until the Renaissance, when the discovery of subjectivity profoundly transformed the arts and sciences. This second great idea governed our perception of reality up until the dawn of the twenty-first century. Zagzebski explores how the interplay of the two ideas led to conflicts that have left us ambivalent about the relationship between the mind and the universe, and have given rise to a host of moral and political rifts over the deepest questions human beings face. Should we organize civil society around the ideal of living in harmony with the world or that of individual autonomy? Zagzebski explains how the two greatest ideas continue to divide us today over issues such as abortion, the environment, free speech, and racial and gender identity. This panoramic book reveals what is missing in our conception of ourselves and the world, and imagines a not-too-distant future when a third great idea, the idea that human minds can grasp each other, will help us gain an idea of the whole of reality.",

        "description": "Capitalism, by the twenty-first century, has brought us an era of escalating, overlapping crisis - ecological, political, social - which we may not survive. In this brilliant, wide-ranging conversation, political philosophers Nancy Fraser and Rahel Jaeggi identify capitalism as the source of the devastation and examine its in-built tendency to crisis. In an exchange that ranges across history, critical theory, ecology, feminism and political theory, Fraser and Jaeggi find that capitalism's tendency to separate what is connected - human from non-human nature, commodity production and social reproduction - is at the heart of its crisis tendency. These \"boundary struggles,\" Fraser and Jaeggi conclude, constitute capitalism's most destructive power but are also the sites where a fighting left movement might be able to halt the destruction and build the non-capitalist future we so desperately need. A crucial text for students of political theory, economic theory, and social change, Capitalism offers an invigorated critique of twenty-first century capitalism and an incisive study of our current conjuncture.",

Across the world, it has captured the imagination as a story of camel caravans crossing desert and mountain, of precious goods moving between East and West, and of ideas, religions and technologies migrating across land and sea. As China seeks to \"revive\" the Silk Roads for the twenty-first century, this compelling, yet poorly understood, narrative of history now serves as a platform for building trade, diplomatic, infrastructure and geopolitical connections. \"The Silk Road: Connecting Histories and Futures\" is the first book to critically investigate the merits and problems of this fabled geocultural narrative of history, and map out the role it plays in international affairs. Four thematic sections trace its rise to global fame as a domain of scholarship and foreign policy, a celebration of peace and internationalism, and how it created dreams of exploration and grand adventure. China's Health Silk Road and civilizational politics are among the themes discussed that open up the Silk Roads as a space for critical enquiry\"--",

Governments are reviewing the rules of usage for consumer data in marketing and advertising in order to take advantage of the huge economic opportunity that the data driven economy represents. Companies, recognizing the opportunity, are hurrying to adapt by digitalizing their processes. They are putting pressure on their managers and working teams to learn how to make best use of the technology capabilities and their data resources. What is more, premier national companies have to compete in a global business field where their Silicon Valley-breed competitors have a substantial advantage in terms of digitalization and data usage. Written in plain English with illustrative examples and cases, this book is for the general manager who seeks a better grasp of this fast-changing business world and a better understanding of what will be required from he/she, not just now but in five years' time.",

Nearly 80 percent of all Fortune 500 companies have been doing their core business through the Internet. Many issues, and societal implications of electronic commerce, are the subjects of recent research. A supply chain consists of all the entities and activities that enable the production, distribution, and delivery of products and services to consumers. Research in designing and managing supply chains has rapidly expanded during the last decade.

The only such landmark collection since Lee Horsley's The Noir Thriller, it extends the argument for serious, academic study of crime fiction, particularly in relation to gender, domestic violence, social and political awareness, psychological acuity, and structural and narratological inventiveness. As well as this, it shifts the debate around the sub-genre firmly up to date and brings together a range of global voices to dissect and situate the notion of 'domestic noir'. This book is essential reading for students, scholars, and fans of the psychological thriller.",

Richard B. Schwartz belongs in the last group, with his own list of approximately seventy favorite writers. Nice and Noir: Contemporary American Crime Fiction explores the work of these writers, building upon a reading of almost seven hundred novels from the 1980s and 1990s. By looking at recurring themes in these mysteries, Schwartz offers readers new ways to approach the works in relation to contemporary cultural concerns.",

Named a Favorite Book of 2015 by Scott MacKay at Rhode Island Public Radio \"Even Providence's signature public art has a dark side in Providence Noir (Akashic), which includes a story called 'WaterFire's Smell Tonight' by Pablo Rodriguez. Each tale in this anthology edited by Ann Hood is set in a different part of the city. Pulitzer Prize winner Elizabeth Strout's story takes place at Trinity Repertory Company. Thomas Cobb, whose novel Crazy Heart was made into a movie with Jeff Bridges, tees up at Triggs Memorial Golf Course, and Dumb and Dumber co-writer and co-director Peter Farrelly, a graduate of Providence College, sets his story in the Elmhurst neighborhood, near his old college stomping grounds.\" --Boston Globe \"Providence, of course, has a history of crime, the mob, corruption and other goodies. In this collection of 15 stories...we are given a darkly hued tour of the city in all its nooks and crannies by such excellent writers as Hood herself, John Searles, Bruce DeSilva, Peter Farrelly, Elizabeth Strout, Hester Kaplan and others, each with their own style, tone and sly approach that will keep you reading, waiting for the sudden murder, the end of troubled relationships, the discovery of bones....[A] wonderful collection.\" --Providence Journal Akashic Books continues its groundbreaking series of original noir anthologies, launched in 2004 with Brooklyn Noir. Each story is set in a distinct neighborhood or location within the city of the book. Featuring brand-new stories by: John Searles, Elizabeth Strout, Taylor M. Polites, Hester Kaplan, Robert Leuci, Amity Gaige, Peter Farrelly, Pablo Rodriguez, Bruce DeSilva, Marie Myung-Ok Lee, Luanne Rice, Dawn Raffel, Thomas Cobb, LaShonda Katrice Barnett, and Ann Hood. Anyone who has spent time in Providence, Rhode Island, knows that lurking in the shadows are many sinister noir elements and characters. The city is ripe for this volume, and Akashic is proud to have recruited the amazing Ann Hood as editor. The impressive contributor list conveys the caliber of Providence Noir, which joins Cape Cod Noir, Boston Noir, and Boston Noir 2: The Classics in sketching a dark and alternative portrait of these New England locales. From the introduction by Ann Hood: \"Providence was founded in 1636 by a rogue named Roger Williams. Williams escaped here when Massachusetts was ready to deport him back to England. In the almost four hundred years since, we've become infamous for all sorts of crimes and misdemeanors, including serving as home base for the Patriarca crime family for decades. My very own Uncle Eddie--I can hear Mama Rose screaming at me: 'He wasn't a blood relative! He was related through marriage!'--was gunned down in the Silver Lake section of town in 1964, just a year after he drove me in his white Cadillac convertible in a parade as the newly crowned Little Miss Natick. The writer Geoffrey Wolff told me that once he went to a barber in Princeton, New Jersey and the barber asked him where he was from. 'Providence,' Wolff told him. The barber put down his scissors, raised his hands in the air, and said, 'Providence? Don't shoot!' \"I've asked fourteen of my favorite writers to contribute short stories to Providence Noir. We have stories to make you shiver, stories to make you think, stories that will show you my beautiful, noirish city in a way it\u2019s never been highlighted before.\"",

But don\u2019t let the alluring vistas fool you. For beneath its veneer as the meeting place of cultures, religions, and ethnicities lies a heart of darkness, seething with suppressed desire, boiling with frustration, and burning with a fervor for vengeance.

        "description": "Carl von Clausewitz's On War, his chef d'oeuvre of strategic and military theory, was first published in 1832, after his death. The book remains a touchstone, dissected and debated by scholars, students, and military personnel around the world who consider it the founding document of the field. Yet to Clausewitz himself, far more important than achieving recognition for his written works was glory on the field of battle. He dreamed of winning renown not with his pen, but with his sword, and wielded both with the same determination and zeal. In this new biographical study of Clausewitz, Donald Stoker moves skillfully between his career as a soldier and his work as a theoretician. Conventional wisdom holds that Clausewitz was \"merely a staff officer\" who didn't see much combat, but Stoker shows this to be far from true. As a soldier during the era of the French Revolution and Napoleonic Wars - perhaps the most intense period of continuous large-scale warfare in history - Clausewitz gained an enormous amount of battle experience. By reconstructing his role in various compaigns, from Jena-Auerstedt to Waterloo, this work offers new insights into Clausewitz as both a soldier in an a witness to the momentous fighting of his time. Taking readers through the heat of these battles, Stoker provides historical overview and strategic analysis, showing the connection between events and Clausewitz's own words, taken both from his works and the abundant letters written to his wife, Marie, and friends throughout his life. Clausewitz's contributions to military theory have solidified his reputation, which seems continually to rise, and Stoker assesses each of his significant works and their contribution to his legacy. Grounding Clausewitz's theoretical analyses on the field of battle, Stoker traces the road to On War, and provides an absorbing reassessment of both the warrior and the theorist. -- from dust jacket.",

        "description": "A story of war and peace in Mozambique and beyond, Memories at Low Altitude spans four decades of southern African history, from the point of view of one of its main protagonists. Jacinto Veloso participated in the Mozambican liberation struggle and served in Samora Machel's cabinet after independence, when the region was dominated by civil war and the conflict between East and West. He describes the effects of the conflict between FRELIMO and the South African-backed RENAMO, and he takes the reader into the negotiation process that resulted in the Non-Aggression and Good Neighbourliness Accord with South Africa, better known as the Nkomati Accord. He also covers the negotiations that contributed to Namibian independence, the withdrawal of Cuban and South African troops from Angola, as well as peace in Mozambique. General Veloso provides fascinating insights because of his closeness to the history that he describes. This book provides a valuable perspective on southern African political and military history, written from a man who was high up in FRELIMO and in Mozambique's government. It provides insights into South Africa's role in the Mozambican civil war and the role that the East-West conflict played in southern Africa during the Cold War. In addition, it explores the effects of the new Mozambique's strictly socialist economy and its subsequent shift to a more market-orientated approach.",

The result is a sympathetic vision of a group of young men who were sent off to war completely unprepared for the emotional and psychological impact it would have on them. It is also a vivid and searingly honest portrayal of the authors post-war, slow-motion breakdown, and how he dealt with it. WELL DONE, THOSE MEN attempts to make sense of what Vietnam did to the soldiers who fought there. It deals with the comic absurdity of their military training and the horror of the war they fought, and is unforgettably moving in recounting what happened to Barry and his comrades when they returned home to Australia.",

        "description": "The Book that Inspired the Academy Award-Winning Film \"The best Patton biography.\"--Military Bookman He is America's most famous general. He represents toughness, focus, determination, and the ideal of achievement in the face of overwhelming odds. He was the most feared and respected adversary to his enemies and an object of envy, admiration, and sometimes, scorn to his professional peers. An early proponent of tank warfare, George S. Patton moved from being a foresighted lieutenant in the First World War to commanding the Third Army in the next, leading armored divisions in the Allied offensive that broke the back of Nazi Germany. Patton was an enigmatic figure. His image among his troops and much of the press achieved legendary status through his bold and colorful comments and combat leadership, yet these same qualities nearly jeopardized his career and forced him out of the battle on several occasions. Victory was impossible without Patton, and returning to the field, his army was responsible for one of the most crushing advances in the history of warfare. In Ladislas Farago's masterpiece, Patton: Ordeal and Triumph, the complete story of this fascinating personality is revealed. Born into an aristocratic California family, Patton rose in military rank quickly and was tapped to lead the Allied landings in North Africa in 1942. Under Patton's direction, American troops cut their teeth against Rommel's Afrikakorps, advanced further and more quickly than British General Montgomery's army in the conquest of Sicily, and ultimately continued their exploits by punching into Germany and checking the Russian westward advance at the end of World War II. A sweeping, absorbing biography and critically hailed, Patton: Ordeal and Triumph provides unique insights into Patton's life and leadership style and is military history at its finest.",

        "description": "During the last few years economics and business education have emerged as one of the largest fields of study in higher education. At the same time, the pressing concern for improving the quality of higher education has led to a definite need for more knowledge about effective instruction and innovation in economics and business education. The book brings together many examples of reform in economics and business education. Special attention is paid to the problem-based learning approach, which over the past ten years, has developed as a very important innovation in higher education. The book contains contributions from a variety of institutions on the necessity of curriculum reform, the choice of instructional methods, assessment and testing, and management of change. It is of interest for teachers in higher education, educational psychologists, and any person interested in educational innovation in economics and business administration.",

This book presents perhaps the most detailed and comprehensive explanation in English to date of how the Japanese train and develop their managers. What influence do government and leading economic organizations have on the system of management education? Will changing attitudes to \"lifetime\" employment affect the principle of life-long adult education? What are the dynamics of Japanese management structures, how do the hierarchies operate and what is the decision-making process? How do management recruitment job rotation, evaluation, and promotion operate in the typical Japanese company? What are the forms and methods of in-company education and training, and how important are external training organizations and why? How will Japanese management education and training practices evolve in the 1990s? The author, Lola Okazaki-Ward, answers these and many related questions in this impressive book, for the first time providing the reader access to numerous original Japanese publications and invaluable information supplied by major Japanese companies.",

        "description": "In order to be effective for their users, information retrieval (IR) systems should be adapted to the specific needs of particular environments. The huge and growing array of types of information retrieval systems in use today is on display in Understanding Information Retrieval Systems: Management, Types, and Standards, which addresses over 20 types of IR systems. These various system types, in turn, present both technical and management challenges, which are also addressed in this volume. In order to be interoperable in a networked environment, IR systems must be able to use various types of technical standards, a number of which are described in this book\u2014often by their original developers. The book covers the full context of operational IR systems, addressing not only the systems themselves but also human user search behaviors, user-centered design, and management and policy issues. In addition to theory and practice of IR system design, the book covers Web standards and protocols, the Semantic Web, XML information retrieval, Web social mining, search engine optimization, specialized museum and library online access, records compliance and risk management, information storage technology, geographic information systems, and data transmission protocols. Emphasis is given to information systems that operate on relatively unstructured data, such as text, images, and music. The book is organized into four parts: Part I supplies a broad-level introduction to information systems and information retrieval systems Part II examines key management issues and elaborates on the decision process around likely information system solutions Part III illustrates the range of information retrieval systems in use today discussing the technical, operational, and administrative issues for each type Part IV discusses the most important organizational and technical standards needed for successful information retrieval This volume brings together authoritative articles on the different types of information systems and how to manage real-world demands such as digital asset management, network management, digital content licensing, data quality, and information system failures. It explains how to design systems to address human characteristics and considers key policy and ethical issues such as piracy and preservation. Focusing on web\u2013based systems, the chapters in this book provide an excellent starting point for developing and managing your own IR systems.",

        "description": "Chapter 1 places into perspective a total Information Storage and Retrieval System. This perspective introduces new challenges to the problems that need to be theoretically addressed and commercially implemented. Ten years ago commercial implementation of the algorithms being developed was not realistic, allowing theoreticians to limit their focus to very specific areas. Bounding a problem is still essential in deriving theoretical results. But the commercialization and insertion of this technology into systems like the Internet that are widely being used changes the way problems are bounded. From a theoretical perspective, efficient scalability of algorithms to systems with gigabytes and terabytes of data, operating with minimal user search statement information, and making maximum use of all functional aspects of an information system need to be considered. The dissemination systems using persistent indexes or mail files to modify ranking algorithms and combining the search of structured information fields and free text into a consolidated weighted output are examples of potential new areas of investigation. The best way for the theoretician or the commercial developer to understand the importance of problems to be solved is to place them in the context of a total vision of a complete system. Understanding the differences between Digital Libraries and Information Retrieval Systems will add an additional dimension to the potential future development of systems. The collaborative aspects of digital libraries can be viewed as a new source of information that dynamically could interact with information retrieval techniques.",

        "description": "The success of information backup systems does not rest on IT administrators alone. Rather, a well-designed backup system comes about only when several key factors coalesce\u2014business involvement, IT acceptance, best practice designs, enterprise software, and reliable hardware. Enterprise Systems Backup and Recovery: A Corporate Insurance Policy provides organizations with a comprehensive understanding of the principles and features involved in effective enterprise backups. Instead of focusing on any individual backup product, this book recommends corporate procedures and policies that need to be established for comprehensive data protection. It provides relevant information to any organization, regardless of which operating systems or applications are deployed, what backup system is in place, or what planning has been done for business continuity. It explains how backup must be included in every phase of system planning, development, operation, and maintenance. It also provides techniques for analyzing and improving current backup system performance. After reviewing the concepts in this book, organizations will be able to answer these questions with respect to their enterprise: What features and functionality should be expected in a backup environment? What terminology and concepts are unique to backup software, and what can be related to other areas? How can a backup system be monitored successfully? How can the performance of a backup system be improved? What features are just \"window dressing\" and should be ignored, as opposed to those features that are relevant? Backup and recovery systems touch on just about every system in an organization. Properly implemented, they can provide an enterprise with greater assurance that its information is safe. By utilizing the information in this book, organizations can take a greater step toward improving the security of their data and preventing the devastating loss of data and business revenue that can occur with poorly constructed or inefficient systems.",

        "description": "Portals present unique strategic challenges in the academic environment. Their conceptualization and design requires the input of campus constituents who seldom interact and whose interests are often opposite. The implementation of a portal requires a coordination of applications and databases controlled by different campus units at a level that may never before have been attempted at the institution. Building a portal is as much about constructing intra-campus bridges as it is about user interfaces and content. Designing Portals: Opportunities and Challenges discusses the current status of portals in higher education by providing insight into the role portals play in an institution's business and educational strategy, by taking the reader through the processes of conceptualization, design, and implementation of the portals (in different stages of development) at major universities and by offering insight from three producers of portal software systems in use at institutions of higher learning and elsewhere.",

His prose refashions the English language into a lean and brilliant instrument, dazzling readers with its energy and wit. In this much anticipated memoir, Amis writes with striking candour about his life and looks intimately at the process of writing itself. As the son of a famous writer, the great comic novelist Kingsley Amis, Martin Amis' explores his relationship with his father and writes about the various crises of Kingsley's life, including the final crisis of his death. Amis also examines the case of his cousin, Lucy Partington, who disappeared without trace in 1973 and was exhumed in 1994 from the back garden of Frederick West, Britain's most prolific serial killer. Inevitably, too, the memoir records the changing literary scene in Britain and the United States, with many anecdotes and pen portraits.",

        "description": "In On Literary Biography, John Updike lays out his skeptical, yet generous, reflections on reading and writing about the lives of literary figures. Asking what satisfactions literary biography may offer readers, he decides that the first and perhaps the most worthy is in allowing us to continue and expand our acquaintance with an author who interests us, so that we may partake again, from another angle, of the joys we have experienced within the author's oeuvre. He tells of finding in a biography of Proust the solid details of what he had previously encountered through that writer's subjective sensibility, but he acknowledges that there can be other reasons for attending to the genre. If the reader is also a writer, a desire to learn the details of a fellow's craft may come into play. Or in a diagnostic mood, readers may seek to relate features of a writer's achievement to the psychological and physical circumstances in which it occurred. Some of us, some of the time, may also take pleasure in seeing the human flaws of writers exposed and in watching as the literary mentality is turned to show an unsavoury side. Updike calls one variant of the biography that uncovers person",

        "description": "The past thirty years have witnessed a rapid growth in the number and variety of courses and programs that study life writing from literary, philosophical, psychological, and cultural perspectives. The field has evolved from the traditional approach that biographies and autobiographies were always about prominent people\u2014historically significant persons, the nobility, celebrities, writers\u2014to the conception of life writing as a genre of interrogation and revelation. The texts now studied include memoirs, testimonios, diaries, oral histories, genealogies, and group biographies and extend to resources in the visual and plastic arts, in films and videos, and on the Internet. Today the tensions between canonical and emergent life writing texts, between the famous and the formerly unrepresented, are making the study of biography and autobiography a far more nuanced and multifarious activity.This volume in the MLA series Options for Teaching builds on and complements earlier work on pedagogical issues in life writing studies. Over forty contributors from a broad range of educational institutions describe courses for every level of postsecondary instruction. Some writers draw heavily on literary and cultural theory; others share their assignments and weekly syllabi. Many essays grapple with texts that represent disability, illness, abuse, and depression; ethnic, sexual and racial discrimination; crises and catastrophes; witnessing and testimonials; human rights violations; and genocide. The classes described are taught in humanities, cultural studies, social science, and language departments and are located in, among other countries, the United States, Great Britain, Canada, Australia, Germany, Eritrea, and South Africa.",

Detained across the continent from the 1960s onward due to their writing and political engagement, each writer's memoir forms a crucial yet often overlooked part of their wider literary work. The author analyses the varied and unique narrative strategies used to portray the prison, formulating a theory of prison memoir as genre that reads the texts alongside postcolonial, trauma, life-writing and prison theory. The book also illustrates the importance of these memoirs in the telling of their historical moment, from apartheid South Africa to post-independence Kenya, Nigeria, Egypt and Malawi.",

        "description": "\"If couples therapy is to produce real transformation, authors Leslie S. Greenberg and Rhonda N. Goldman argue, the process must be hot: Emotion must be activated. Emotion fuels conflicts; therefore, therapists need to help couples get at the primary emotions that power negative interactional cycles and transform these emotions into more adaptive, functional ones. In Emotion-focused couples therapy: The dynamics of emotion, love, and power, Greenberg and Goldman explore the foundations of emotion-focused couples therapy (EFT-C) and expand its framework to focus more intently on the development of the self and relationships. The authors show how EFT-C can promote soothing and help clients deal with unmet needs from adulthood and childhood. They discuss the affect regulation involved in three major motivational systems central to couples therapy--attachment, identity, and attraction--and clarify the role of emotions and motivations in the dominance dimension of couples interactions. Written with practitioners and graduate students in mind, the chapters present a rich variety of case material to demonstrate how working with emotions can facilitate change in couples and, by extension, in all situations in which people may be in emotional conflict with others. Greenberg and Goldman provide the tools needed to identify specific emotions and show the reader how to work with them to resolve conflict and promote bonding in couples therapy\"--Jacket.

        "description": "This book will help the reader to understand the suicidal mind from a phenomenological point of view, shedding light on the feelings of suicidal individuals and also those of clinicians. In accordance with the importance that the phenomenological approach attaches to subjectivity and sense of self as the starting points for knowledge, emphasis is placed on the need for the clinician to focus on the subjective experiences of the at-risk individual, to set aside prior assumptions, judgments, or interpretations, and to identify ways of bridging gaps in communication associated with negative emotions. The vital importance of empathy is stressed, drawing attention to the insights offered by neuroimaging studies and the role of mirror neurons in social cognition. It is widely acknowledged that when a clinician meets a person who wants to die by suicide, the clinician does not fully understand what is going on inside the mind of that individual. This book recognizes that any approach to suicide prevention must promote understanding of suicidal thoughts and feelings. The awareness that it fosters and the innovative perspectives that it presents will appeal to a wide readership.",

        "description": "Robert C. Solomon, who died in 2007, was Professor of Philosophy and Quincy Lee Centennial Professor of Business at the University of Texas, USA. As the first book comprehensively to examine the breadth of Solomon\u2019s contribution to philosophy, this volume ranks as a vital addition to the literature. It includes a newly published transcript of Solomon\u2019s last talk, which responded to Arindam Chakrabarti on the concept of revenge, as well as the considered views of prominent figures in the numerous subfields in which Solomon worked. The content analyses his perspectives on the philosophy of emotion, virtue, business ethics, and religion, in addition to philosophical history, existentialism, and the many other topics that held this prolific thinker\u2019s attention. Solomon memorably defined philosophy itself as \u2018the thoughtful love of life\u2019, and despite the diversity of his output, he was most drawn by central questions about the meaning of life, the essential role that emotions play in finding that meaning, and the human imperative to seek \u2018emotional integrity\u2019, in which one\u2019s thoughts, emotions, and actions all contribute to a coherent narrative. The essays included here draw attention to the interconnections between the issues Solomon addressed, and evince the manner in which he embodied that integrity, living a life at one with his philosophy. They emphasize the central themes of passion, ethics, and spirituality, which threaded through his work, and the way these ideas informed his views on how we should approach grief and death. The multiplicity of topics alone make this keystone work an enlightening read for a full spectrum of students of philosophy, providing much to ponder and recounting a subtle and shining example of the emotional integrity Solomon worked so hard to define.",

        "description": "This book defends the much-disputed view that emotions are what Hume referred to as \u2018original existences\u2019: feeling states that have no intentional or representational properties of their own. In doing so, the book serves as a valuable counterbalance to the now mainstream view that emotions are representational mental states. Beginning with a defence of a feeling theory of emotion, Whiting opens up a whole new way of thinking about the role and centrality of emotion in our lives, showing how emotion is key to a proper understanding of human motivation and the self. Whiting establishes that emotions as types of bodily feelings serve as the categorical bases for our behavioural dispositions, including those associated with moral thought, virtue, and vice. The book concludes by advancing the idea that emotions make up our intrinsic nature - the characterisation of what we are like in and of ourselves, when considered apart from how we are disposed to behave. The conclusion additionally draws out the implications of the claims made throughout the book in relation to our understanding of mental illness and the treatment of emotional disorders.",

        "description": "Gay and Lesbian Literature Since World War II chronicles the multifaceted explosion of gay and lesbian writing that has taken place in the second half of the twentieth century. Encompassing a wide range of subject matter and a balance of gay and lesbian concerns, it includes work by established scholars as well as young theoreticians and archivists who have initiated new areas of investigation. The contributors\u2019examinations of this rich literary period make it easy to view the half-century from 1948 to 1998 as the Queer Renaissance. Included in Gay and Lesbian Literature Since World War II are critical and social analyses of literary movements, novels, short fiction, periodicals, and poetry as well as a look at the challenges of establishing a repository for lesbian cultural history. Specific chapters in this groundbreaking work trace the development of gay poetry in America after World War II; examine how AIDS is represented in the first four Latino novels to deal with the subject matter; and chronicle the birth of lesbian-feminist publishing in the 1970s--showing how it created a flourishing gay literature in the 1980s and 1990s. Other chapters: outline the history of The Ladder from its initial publication in 1956 as the official vehicle of the Daughters of Bilitis to its final issue as a privately published literary magazine in 1972 examine Baldwin\u2019s 1962 novel Another Country and discuss the complicated critical history of this work and its relation to Baldwin\u2019s literary reputation--racial, sexual, and political factors are taken into account chart how Other Voices, Other Rooms, by Truman Capote, and The House of Breath, by William Goyen, reveal contradictory genderings of male homosexuality--suggesting an absence of a unified model of mid-twentieth-century male homosexuality argue that the 1976 novel Lover, by Bertha Harris, can be considered an exemplary novel within discussions of both postmodern fiction and lesbian theory. (The author calls for Harris to be added to the group of writers such as Wittig, Anzald\u00faa, Lorde, and Winterson, who are discussed within the context of a postmodern lesbian narrative.) examine the short fiction of Canadian lesbian novelist Jane Rule in an effort to shed light on lesbian creative practice in the homophobic climate of postwar North America argue for an understanding of Dale Peck\u2019s novel Martin and John as an attempt to link two apparently different processes of import to contemporary male subjects through examination of the novel alongside selected passages from Nietzsche and Freud focus on the pragmatic issues of developing and maintaining accessible research venues from which to cultivate the study of racial and cultural diversity in lesbian lives Document the history of the Lesbian Herstory Archives, one of the first lesbian-specific collections in the world, from its birth in the early 1970s to the present.",

        "description": "While abundant research has investigated time use, much less attention has been given to the cultural meanings attached to free time and what these may express with regard to conceptions of freedom and the self. In an attempt to fill this gap, Michelle Shir-Wise examines not only what people do in their free time, but also how they perceive, interpret and experience it, and in what way it relates to notions of happiness, freedom and the ideal self. Time, Freedom and the Self draws on contemporary theoretical debates concerning the relation between discourse, cultural repertoires, subjective meaning and agency, as well as literature around the sociology of leisure, to inform a unique interpretation of free time (\u201cdisciplined freedom\u201d), developed in the light of questionnaires and in-depth interviews with middle-class, middle-aged participants in suburban Israel.",

Exploring the globalised therapeutic culture of today, the book argues that psychology as 'science' is often abandoned to aid the individual pursuit for self-realization and self-optimization. Opposing the view that self-help culture is external to psychology, Madsen argues that it is firmly embedded within psychology, playing an important role in people's lives. Each chapter traces and critically interprets a range of self-help philosophies and techniques, examining the claims of self-help literature to represent the most innovative psychological, medical or neurobiological research. Discussing each genre in turn, chapters examine key research alongside self-help literature to explore the effectiveness and impact of leading self-help genres in various social contexts and environments. The book offers a contemporary critical overview of issues concerning self-help, combining critical psychology with the theory of social representation to provide a broad perspective on self-help as a valid psychology. Optimizing the Self will be of interest to academics, researchers and postgraduate students in the fields of social representation, critical and cultural psychology and theory, clinical psychology, and the sociology of culture and science. The book will also be of use to critical and cultural psychologists and theorists, as well as clinical psychologists.",

The Sisters, a cult classic among aficionados is finally available again as Overlook republishes Littell's best. Enigmatic and extremely dangerous, CIA legends Francis and Carroll have been dubbed \"The sisters Death and Night\" by their cohorts. But few know what they do. They plot, and they're plotting the perfect crime. They've located the perfect pawn-the Potter, the exiled ex-head of the KGB sleeper school-and, with artful deception, the Sisters coerce him into betraying his last and best sleeper, the man he considers his son. Once awakened, this sleeper, an assassin living secretly in the United States, will launch a mission of death-unless the Potter, in a desperate race against time, can stop him.",

Taking a \u201ctotal\u201d view of strategy, Black looks at leading powers\u2014notably the United States, China, Britain, and Russia\u2014in the wider context of their competition and their domestic and international strengths. Ranging from France\u2019s ancien r\u00e9gime and Britain\u2019s empire building to present-day conflicts in the Middle East, Black devotes particular attention to the strategic practice and decisions of the Kangxi Emperor, Clausewitz, Napoleon, and Hitler.",

        "description": "What changes in China's modern military policy reveal about military organizations and strategySince the 1949 Communist Revolution, China has devised nine different military strategies, which the People's Liberation Army (PLA) calls \"strategic guidelines.\" What accounts for these numerous changes? Active Defense offers the first systematic look at China's military strategy from the mid-twentieth century to today. Exploring the range and intensity of threats that China has faced, M. Taylor Fravel illuminates the nation's past and present military goals and how China sought to achieve them, and offers a rich set of cases for deepening the study of change in military organizations.Drawing from diverse Chinese-language sources, including memoirs of leading generals, military histories, and document collections that have become available only in the last two decades, Fravel shows why transformations in military strategy were pursued at certain times and not others. He focuses on the military strategies adopted in 1956, 1980, and 1993-when the PLA was attempting to wage war in a new kind of way-to show that China has pursued major change in its strategic guidelines when there has been a significant shift in the conduct of warfare in the international system and when China's Communist Party has been united.Delving into the security threats China has faced over the last seven decades, Active Defense offers a detailed investigation into how and why states alter their defense policies.",

        "description": "This textbook provides a comprehensive introduction to post-Cold War military theory for students of strategic studies. This second edition has been fully revised and updated, including a new chapter on peacekeeping, and examines contemporary strategic thought on the conduct of war in the sea, land, air, nuclear, space and cyber domains, as well as irregular warfare. Each chapter identifies contemporary strategic thinkers in a particular area, examines strategic thought through the lens of identifiable themes, and discusses the ideas of classical strategists to provide historical context. Examples of the link between the use of military force and the pursuit of political objectives are presented, such as airpower against ISIS and in Libya, counterinsurgency in Afghanistan and Iraq, counter-piracy operations off the coast of Africa, and the Stuxnet virus in Iran. The chapters identify trends, statements and principles that indicate how military power can best be employed to effect political ends, while the conclusion paints an overall picture of the relationship between classic and contemporary strategic thinking within each warfare domain. This book will be essential reading for students of strategic studies, war studies and military history, and is highly recommended for students of security studies and international relations in general.",

        "description": "Military Strategy of Middle Powers explores to what degree twenty-first-century middle powers adjust their military strategies due to changes in the international order, such as the decline in US power. The overarching objective of the book is to explain continuity and change in the strategies of a group of middle powers during the twenty-first century. These strategies are described, compared, and explained through the lens of Realism. In order to find potential explanations for change or continuity within the cases, as well as for similarities and differences between the cases, the strategies of 11 \u2018middle\u2019 powers are analysed (Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, Australia, Brazil, Indonesia, South Africa, India, Japan, and South Korea). This group of countries are considered similar in several important aspects, primarily regarding relative power capacity. When searching for potential explanations for different strategic behaviours among the middle powers, their unique regional characteristics are a key focus and, consequently, the impact of the structure and polarity, as well as the patterns of amity and enmity, of the regional context are analysed. The empirical investigation is focused on security strategies used since the terrorist attacks 9/11 2001, which was one of the first major challenges to US hegemony. This book will be of much interest to students of military and strategic studies, foreign policy, and International Relations in general.",

        "description": "As a veteran campaigner, the Byzantine emperor Maurice (582-602) compiled a unique and influential handbook intended for the field commander. In this first complete English translation, the Strategikon is an invaluable source not only for early Byzantine history but for the general history of the art of war. Describing in detail weaponry and armor, daily life on the march or in camp, clothing, food, medical care, military law, and titles of the Byzantine army of the seventh century, the Strategikon offers insights into the Byzantine military ethos. In language contemporary, down-to-earth, and practical, the text also provides important data for the historian, and even the ethnologist, including eyewitness accounts of the Persians, Slavs, Lombards, and Avars at the frontier of the Empire.",

        "description": "This 2007 book examines environmental law from a range of perspectives, emphasising the policy world from which environmental law is drawn and nourished. Those working within the discipline of environmental law need to engage with concepts and methods employed by disciplines other than law. The authors analyse the ways in which legal activities are supported and legitimated by work in traditional scientific or technical domains, as well as by certain more obscure but also influential cultural or philosophical assumptions. A range of regulatory techniques is explored in this book, through a close examination of both pollution control and land use. The highly complex nature of current environmental problems, demanding sophisticated and responsive legal controls, is illustrated by several in-depth case studies, including legal and policy analysis of the highly contested issues of genetically modified organisms and renewable energy projects.",

Although the committee cannot predict with certainty what new environmental problems EPA will face in the next 10 years or more, it worked to identify some of the common drivers and common characteristics of problems that are likely to occur. Tensions inherent to the structure of EPA's work contribute to the current and persistent challenges faced by the agency, and meeting those challenges will require development of leading-edge scientific methods, tools, and technologies, and a more deliberate approach to systems thinking and interdisciplinary science. Science for Environmental Protection: The Road Ahead outlines a framework for building science for environmental protection in the 21st century and identified key areas where enhanced leadership and capacity can strengthen the agency's abilities to address current and emerging environmental challenges as well as take advantage of new tools and technologies to address them. The foundation of EPA science is strong, but the agency needs to continue to address numerous present and future challenges if it is to maintain its science leadership and meet its expanding mandates.",

Examples from Germany and Poland are discussed due to the efficiency of their respective implementations of water conservation policies. Although the general scientific interest in specific issues such as wetlands, climate change, nature conservation and the WFD enjoy a well established position in international environmental research, these four elements are rarely considered together due to the complexity of the processes, biased scenarios of global change and subjective policy background. Major challenges involved in carrying out environmental conservation actions that assess the potential impacts of climate change and management plans on water bodies are identified. The results of this approach are addressed to practitioners in the field of adaptive management in a wetlands context.",

Environmental Protection Agency Office of Research and Development 2 Pell Center for International Relations and Public Policy Salve Regina University 1. Nontraditional Threats to Security The events of September 11, 2001 have sharpened the debate over the meaning of being secure. Before 9/11 there were warnings in all parts of the world that social and environmental changes were occurring. While there was prosperity in North America and Western Europe, there was also increasing recognition that local and global effects of ecosystem degradation posed a serious threat. Trekking from Cairo to Cape Town thirty years after living in Africa as a young teacher, for example, travel writer Paul Theroux concluded that development in sub-Saharan Africa had failed to improve the quality of life for 300 million people: \u201cAfrica is materially more decrepit than it was when I first knew it\u2014hungrier, poorer, less educated, more pessimistic, more corrupt, and you can\u2019t tell the politicians from the witch-doctors\u201d (2002). While scholars and historians will debate the causes of 9/11 for some time, one message is clear: An often dizzying array of nontraditional threats and complex vulnerabilities define security today. We must understand them, and deal with them, or suffer the consequences. Environmental security has always required att- tion to nontraditional threats linked closely with social and economic well-being.",

        "description": "Located in the heart of the Eastern Himalayas, Bhutan practices the philosophy of Gross National Happiness (\u201cGNH\u201d) that embraces environmental conservation as one of the main building blocks for its sustainable development goals. Bhutan\u2019s conservation strategies and success are largely driven by the strong political will and visionary leadership of His Majesty the King of Bhutan The nation\u2019s Buddhist perspectives regarding a deep and abiding respect for nature; and the strategic enforcement of a wide-ranging stringent set of internal regulations and controls have helped ensure ecological gold standards in Bhutan. Moreover, the country is an active member of the international conservation community by fulfilling its implementation of various Multilateral Environment Agreements. While it emerged into the 21st century as one of the 36 global terrestrial \u201chotspots\u201d in biological diversity conservation ranks, Bhutan\u2019s sheer commitment with more than 51% of its territory being managed under the explicit status of a protected area network, and more than 70% of the land under forest cover, represents Bhutan\u2019s exemplary dedication to protect the planet despite its smallness in size and economy, and the biological fragility exemplified by its hotspot situation. In the face of imminent severe threats of global warming, Bhutan nonetheless exemplifies the truth that \u201ca small country with a big conservation commitment\u201d can make an enormous contribution to the global community. At the regional level, Bhutan is intent upon protecting the Water Towers of Asia (that glacial expanse of the Himalayas) which is a critical resource bulwark for about one-fifth of the global population downstream in South Asia. Such protections invariably help mitigate climate change by acting as a nation-wide carbon sink through its carbon neutral policies. In short, Bhutan has long represented one of the world\u2019s foremost national guardians of biodiversity conservation, ecological good governance, and societal sustainability at a period when the world has entered the Anthropocene \u2013 an epoch of mass extinctions. We envision this publication to be ecologically and ethically provocative and revealing for the concerned scientific communities, and governments. Through an extensive review of the scientific and anthropological literature, as well as the research team's own data, the Author's have set forth timely recommendations for conservation policies, strategies and actions. This book provides technical and deeply considered assessments of the state of Bhutan\u2019s environment, its multiple, human-induced stressors and pressures; as well as extremely sound, practical techniques that would address conservation strategies in the Himalayas and, by implication, worldwide.",

Environmental conservation is the protection of the environment on various levels for the continued sustainability of the varied ecosystems on Earth. Environmental management involves sustainability of the oceans, soil, freshwater systems and atmosphere. Some of the common practices to reduce the adverse impact of human activities include environmental resources management, environment-friendly engineering and environmental protection. Environmental conservation and management can also be achieved by living sustainably, through systematic changes to urban planning, transport, individual lifestyles, consumerism, etc. This book elucidates new techniques and their applications in a multidisciplinary manner. It presents some key concepts associated with environmental conservation and management while also focussing on the advancements made in this field of study. From theories to research to practical applications, case studies related to all contemporary topics of relevance to this field have been included in this book. Scientists and students actively engaged in this field will find this book full of crucial and unexplored concepts.",

        "description": "Through a combination of theoretical and empirical approaches, this book explores the role of international environmental law in protecting and conserving plants. Underpinning every ecosystem on the planet, plants provide the most basic requirements: food, shelter and clear air. Yet the world\u2019s plants are in trouble; a fifth of all plant species are at risk of extinction, with thousands more in perpetual decline. In a unique study of international environmental law, this book provides a comprehensive overview of the challenges and restrictions associated with protecting and conserving plants. Through analysing the relationship between conservation law and conservation practice, the book debates whether the two work symbiotically, or if the law poses more of a hindrance than a help. Further discussion of the law\u2019s response to some of the major threats facing plants, notably climate change, international trade and invasive species, grounds the book in conservation literature. Using case studies on key plant biomes to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the law in practice, the book also includes previously unpublished results of an original empirical study into the correlations between the IUCN Red List and lists of endangered/protected species in international instruments. To conclude, the book looks to the future, considering broader reforms to the law to support the work of conservation practitioners and reshape humanity\u2019s relationships with nature. The book will be of interest to scholars and students working in the field of international environmental law and those interested more broadly in conservation and ecological governance frameworks.",

        "description": "What makes poetry a good read is the creativity in the rhymes and rhythms. The author, wanting to delight the readers with humor, told short stories through stanzas and lines. He used an unconventional technique, which is mostly childish and funny yet enjoyable. Each poem discusses a certain topic, sometimes about childhood tales and characters, while other times about war, love, and adulthood. The reader shall be brought into a different world and shall meet a new persona in every page turn. Divided into four parts, this collection of poems gives the effect like an undulating ocean, without disappointing the reader about the word play that comes in every part. Humorous Poems and Others of the Twenty-First Century: Volume I, by Erwin K. Yarbrough, Jr., delves about diverse topics that are pleasurable to read from end to end.",

I was doing this for a while before I realized the restrictions of the curriculum, I found out that there were not much I could expand on because of the time given to do so and I felt frustrated and clustered inside because there were so much more I wanted to say and that was when I started jotting down the way I felt and some things I wanted to say. When I go home in the evenings I would think a lot about what I wanted to say to the people but can\u2019t. I kept this inside for two years, the time required to fulfill that voluntary services but just before my time was up the ministry of education sent me an invitation to attend teacher\u2019s college tuition free but I turned it down and went on to study book keeping and accounting instead at the Jamaica Commercial Institute, so while going to school I formed a club so we could promote social events inside the school among the classes and that was when I started reciting some of the poems I was writing as lyrics to songs. Ultimately after years of writing and performing some of these writings and the encouragement of some of my producers and life on a whole keep changing I decided to publish these poetry to share with the world my more that I\u2019ve always wanted and still do want to say.",

His close observation of people and places, in his hometown, Kashmir or during his wide travels in plains, deserts, high hill mountain ranges, including the icy land of Antarctica and his understanding of what goes through a soldier heart and mind, have contributed substantially to the creation of this book. The author takes you on a gripping journey through his poems on romance, unrequited love, motherhood, relations, battlefield, personal loss and social concerns that presently pose a great challenge to humanity.",

While vast amounts of corporate money, government policy and media time are directed at the social and ethical activities of large corporations, small businesses don\u2019t generally attract the spotlight. This is wildly inappropriate, however, since upward of 90% of private businesses are small or medium sized. This book goes some way to helping us understand the social and ethical contribution of this majority organizational form. The first section of the book is a global round-up of research on ethics in small and medium sized enterprises from major regions of the world. In the second section smaller scale research projects from a variety of countries present both empirical and theoretical advances in the area. Anyone with an interest in ethics and small and medium sized enterprises should find this an inspiring book which paves the way for future research.",

        "description": "Veblen has been claimed and rejected both by sociologists and economists as being one of theirs. He enriched and attacked both disciplines, as he did so many others: philosophy, history, social psychology, politics, and linguistics. Because he took all knowledge as necessary and relevant to adequate understanding, Veblen was a holistic analyst of the social process. First published in 1904, this classic analysis of the U.S. economy has enduring value today. In it, Veblen posited a theory of business fluctuations and economic growth which included chronic depression and inflation. He predicted the socioeconomic changes that would occur as a result: militarism, imperialism, fascism, consumerism, and the development of the mass media as well as the corporate bureaucracy. Douglas Dowd's introduction places the volume within the traditions of both macroeconomics and microeconomics, tracing Veblen's place among social thinkers, and the place of this volume in the body of his work.",

        "description": "Since the 2008 economic crisis, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have faced serious financial problems and have been looking to financial institutions and governments for solutions and new proposals to address these issues. This book examines the new challenge in which firms receive sustainable funding that is in alignment with the company\u2019s spending capacity. The purpose of this book is to examine the main theoretical issues and practices regarding entrepreneurship and finance and their impact on performance, innovation and economic growth. It analyzes the fundamental aspects of entrepreneurship and studies ways in which financial institutions can better fulfill their primary function of feeding capital to businesses and the economy as a whole. Entrepreneurship and finance are fundamental to achieving success in economic and social activities. SMEs\u2019 existence and development depend on the initiatives of entrepreneurship and access to resources, especially those of a financial nature. During the recent economic crisis, several new financing instruments have appeared, especially with structures designed for helping SMEs make their way out of the recession. This book explores some of these tools in various global economies, such as France and Spain, providing an international, multidimensional perspective.",

Building on existing research, the authors present a new conceptual research model that links multidimensional variables, such as entrepreneurial orientation, and human capital, with the perceived availability of different forms of financing for high-growth companies and with the measures that these firms take to overcome financial constraints and thus influence their financial performance. With this model the authors aim to enhance our understanding of the specifics of financing high growth companies and demonstrate how the availability of financial resources is one of the most important determinants of promoting development and enterprise growth. Empirically tested on a random sample of high-growth companies from Slovenia, the book seeks to make a contribution to research and enhance our understanding of the various factors involved in high growth firms.",

        "description": "This revised edition of a now classic text includes a new introduction by Henry Jenkins, explaining \u2018Why Fiske Still Matters\u2019 for today\u2019s students, followed by a discussion between former Fiske students Kevin Glynn, Jonathan Gray, and Pamela Wilson on the theme of \u2018Reading Fiske and Understanding the Popular\u2019. Both underline the continuing relevance of this foundational text in the study of popular culture. What is popular culture? How does it differ from mass culture? And what do popular \"texts\" reveal about class, race, and gender dynamics in a society? John Fiske answers these and a host of other questions in Understanding Popular Culture. When it was first written, Understanding Popular Culture took a groundbreaking approach to studying such cultural artifacts as jeans, shopping malls, tabloid newspapers, and TV game shows, which remains relevant today. Fiske differentiates between mass culture \u2013 the cultural \"products\" put out by an industrialized, capitalist society \u2013 and popular culture \u2013 the ways in which people use, abuse, and subvert these products to create their own meanings and messages. Rather than focusing on mass culture\u2019s attempts to dominate and homogenize, he prefers to look at (and revel in) popular culture\u2019s evasions and manipulations of these attempts. Designed as a companion to Reading the Popular, Understanding Popular Culture presents a radically different theory of what it means for culture to be popular: that it is, literally, of the people. It is not imposed on them, it is created by them, and its pleasures and meanings reflect popular tastes and concerns \u2013 and a rejection of those fostered by mass culture. With wit, clarity, and insight, Professor Fiske debunks the myth of the mindless mass audience, and demonstrates that, in myriad ways, popular culture thrives because that audience is more aware than anyone guesses.",

Organized around the central theme of music as an expression of local, ethnic, social and other identities, the essays touch upon popular traditions and contemporary forms from several different regions of the world: political engagement in Italian popular music; flamenco in Spain; the challenge of traditional music in Bulgaria; boerenrock and rap in Holland; Israeli extreme heavy metal; jazz and pop in South Africa, and musical hybridity and politics in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. The collection includes essays about Latin America: on the Mexican corrido, the Caribbean, popular dance music in Cuba, and bossanova from Brazil. Communities of a cultural diaspora in North America are discussed in essays on Somali immigrant and refugee youth and Iranians in exile in the US. Grounded in cultural theory and a specialized knowledge of a particular popular musical practice, each author has written a critical study on the mix of music and identity in a particular social practice and context.",

        "description": "In the American world, the presence of African culture is sometimes fully embodied and sometimes leaves only a trace. Africa in the American Imagination: Popular Culture, Racialized Identities, and African Visual Culture explores this presence, examining Mattel's world of Barbie, the 1996 Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue, and Disney World, each of which repackages African visual culture for consumers. Because these cultural icons permeate American life, they represent the broader U.S. culture and its relationship to African culture. This study integrates approaches from art history and visual culture studies with those from culture, race, and popular culture studies to analyze this interchange. Two major threads weave throughout. One analyzes how the presentation of African visual culture in these popular culture forms conceptualizes Africa for the American public. The other investigates the way the uses of African visual culture focuses America's own self-awareness, particularly around black and white racialized identities. In exploring the multiple meanings that \u201cAfrica\u201d has in American popular culture, Africa in the American Imagination argues that these cultural products embody multiple perspectives and speak to various sociopolitical contexts: the Cold War, civil rights, and contemporary eras of the United States; the apartheid and post-apartheid eras of South Africa; the colonial and postcolonial eras of Ghana; and the European era of African colonization.",

He argues that culture should be treated as an historical term, and traces the debate between high culture and popular culture in industrialised society from the 18th century to the present day.\" \"Goodall then locates the debate in Australia, arguing that it is of particular relevance to a postcolonial society. More than any other modern culture, Australia has sought its identity in its sense of struggle between populism and elitism.\" \"Finally, Goodall broaches the contentious topic of the relationship between the 'new' cultural studies and the 'old' humanities. Rather than simply defending one and denigrating the other, he points the way to a more productive relationship.\"--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.

        "description": "Changing Views of Business Marketing This book aims to provide an in-depth understanding of long-term busi in industrial markets. During the late 1980s our view ness relationships on business marketing changed remarkably. From a single-transaction oriented, market mechanism-based description of marketing and purchas ing, we are moving into domestic and international buyer-seller relation ships. In academic terms, we are experiencing a broadening of the para digms that describe how companies interact. This change in focus has its roots in the recognition that business marketing is frequently characterized by long-term interaction, coopera tion, and coalitions between participant firms. The forces of quality, total cost management, and the need to decrease response times in new prod uct/service development all are combining to accelerate the trend to wards strategic relationships. In increasingly global markets, different forms of strategic alliances provide ways of joining forces in attempts to reach goals beyond any single firm's resources. Also, our way of seeing the corporate environment is changing. In stead of the traditional view of markets or industries as constituted by independent companies operating mainly through market competition, we are starting to realize that markets can be more realistically defined and described as networks of interlinked organizations. The network view offers a highly promising tool for describing and analyzing the rapidly integrating global marketplace. For instance, strategic alliances can be seen as moves of establishing positions in a network or as ways of changing the whole network.",

        "description": "\"The frictions that we experience when doing business, and in fact also in society, result from the impact of technology. There is a transition period from \"doing digital\" to \"being digital\". This affects every aspect of our lives, both private and professional. Merely observing the changes, reading about conflicts of the old model in relation to the new model, is confusing. The current developments and frictions require more in-depth examination. Insights into these developments will be necessary in order to achieve success. Many more partnerships will develop; organisations will come together and combine forces and borders will disappear. This will lead to the changes from order entry to new digital business ecosystems, or rather from \"doing digital to \"being digital\". In the book, The End of Competition: The Impact of the Network Economy, the author explores the indicators of change, the motives for change, and the changes that are yet to come. Concrete plans provide clarity regarding the steps that can be taken, and they indicate who is already going down that road. This book will cover the similarities and differences in the approach and developments in both the Western and Asian worlds. We are at the beginning of a new age: the age of \"being digital\", and closing our eyes to this is to deny ourselves a future\"--",

As such, mobile communications offers opportunities for media development because of an increased overlap between interpersonal and group communications with mass media communications, ubiquitous access to trusted media brands as well as integrated cross-network strategies for media content. The book takes two different viewpoints on potential levers for the developments of the media industry and mobile media: from a competitive strategy point of view it assesses the potentials for an extension of cross-media strategies; from a public policy point of view the book investigates demands and requirements for innovation policy that foster innovation in mobile media markets.

        "description": "In this book the authors describe their original research on the potential of both standard and high-resolution electroencephalography (EEG) for analyzing brain activity in response to TV advertising. When engineering techniques, neuroscience concepts and marketing stimuli converge in one research field, known as neuromarketing, various theoretical and practical aspects need to be considered. The book introduces and discusses those aspects in detail, while showing several experiments performed by the authors during their attempts to measure both the cognitive activity and emotional involvement of the test subjects. In these experiments, the authors apply simultaneous EEG, galvanic skin response and heart rate monitoring, and show how significant variations of these variables can be associated with attention to, memorization or enjoyment of the presented stimuli. In particular, this book shows the central role of statistical analysis in recovering significant information on the scalp and cortical areas involved, along with variations of activity in the autonomous nervous system. From an economic and marketing perspective, the aim of this work is to promote a better understanding of how mass consumer advertising of (established) brands affects brain systems. From a neuroscience perspective, the broader goal is to provide a better understanding of both the neural mechanisms underlying the impact of affect and cognition on memory, and the neural correlates of choice and decision-making. => Please download the extra material for this book http://extras.springer.com",

They are named Neural Networks, Multilayer Perceptrons, Genetic algorithms, Cellular Automates, Self-Organizing maps, Fuzzy Logic, etc. They can be summarized by the word of Connectionism, and consist of an interdisciplinary domain between neuroscience, cognitive science and engineering. First they were applied in computer sciences, engineering, biological models, pattern recognition, motor control, learning algorithms, etc. But rapidly, it appeared that these methods could be of great interest in the fields of Economics and Management Sciences. The main difficulty was the distance between researchers, the difference in the vocabulary used by the ones and the others, their basic background. The main notions used by these new techniques were not familiar to the Social and Human Sciences researchers. What are they ? Four of them are now very briefly introduced, but the reader will find more information in the following chapters.",

        "description": "This book presents an integration of the analysis of symbo- lic, ethical, and cultural meaning into the theory of econo- mic action. It demontrates that the scope of economics is widened by the inclusion of the cultural and ethical determinants of economic action and by bringing the ethical and cultural factors back into economics and management science. The book's contribution to business ethics and economic ethics lies in its distinctly continental European background which is often overlooked in current discussions of economic theory. The papers in this volume point to a mutual interpenetration of economics and ethics in a new synthesis of \"ethical economy\".",

        "description": "Methodology is the ?eld which is indisputably complex. In the academic world, it is often said to be important, yet in everyday academic practice, it is not always treated accordingly. In teaching, methodology is often a mandatory course. Usually, it consists of learning how to adopt several common approaches when doing research, and how to conceive a research design (often leading to a survey). This usually leads to collecting data on a modest scale and \u2013 when the opportunity arises \u2013 analysing the data with the help of some statistics. Ask the students of their opinion at the end of such a course and they tend to heave a deep sigh of relief and say, \u201cI have got through it. \u201d Then their real courses start again, in which methodology often does not play a role at all. We are of the opinion that writing-off methodology in this way is a real pity. It ignores the valuable role that methodology should play in academic teaching as a whole. Here, methodology is presented as a form of thinking and acting that, while obviously entailing research work, can also include the design and change of organisations. This broad approach has been purposefully chosen, as it is almost obvious from research and graduation projects that the students do not really have a clue what methodology involves and, therefore, wasting their time by producing work that has a little quality.",

It debunks the unhelpful dichotomy between quantitative and qualitative research and highlights the great value of multi-method and interactive research, approaches that have greatly deepened our thinking.' \u2013 Professor Adrian Payne, University of New South Wales, Australia / Professor Pennie Frow, University of Sydney Setting out to dispel the argument that case study research lacks the science, theory and therefore validity of other forms of research, Evert Gummesson combines many decades of experience as both a renowned scholar and a reflective practitioner to effectively bridge the divide between case theory and how it is applied in practice. Bringing the fundamental strengths of cases to the fore, Gummesson introduces the 'Case Theory' concept as an expanded version of case study research which includes both methodology and the types of results that emerge by: Guiding the reader in the theoretical and philosophical underpinning Demonstrating how to translate theory to pertinent research practice that address the real and consequential issues in business and management today. This book will appeal to students, academics and researchers who are interested in the science and philosophy behind case study research as well as the methodology and a thought-provoking read for anyone who wants to be challenged about their belief of case study theory.",

        "description": "Ever since the first Olympic Games in Ancient Greece, sports have become an integral part of human civilization. The last decade has been commemorated by the centennial celebration of the modern Olympic movement. With great anticipation, the Olympics return to Athens, Greece, and we are once again reminded that we live in one of the most exciting periods in the history of sports. Reflecting back on my years of service as the International Olympic Com mittee president, I cannot overlook the remarkable changes that have taken place in the world of sports during these two decades. The technological de velopment and consequent globalization of the world economy opened up a window of new opportunities for the sports industry. As a result, manage ment, economics, and other sciences have become a significant part of modern sports. It is my pleasure to introduce this volume comprising an interesting collec tion of papers dealing with various aspects of management, economics and optimization applied to sports. May this book serve as a valuable source of information to researchers and practitioners as well as to casual readers look ing for a deeper insight into the magnificent world of sports.",

We know intuitively that these states express deep things about our character and our view of the world. But what are emotions and why are they so important to us? In one of the most extensive investigations of the emotions ever published, Robert Roberts develops a novel conception of what emotions are and then applies it to a large range of types of emotion and related phenomena. In so doing he lays the foundations for a deeper understanding of our evaluative judgments, our actions, our personal relationships and our fundamental well-being. Aimed principally at philosophers and psychologists, this book will certainly be accessible to readers in other disciplines such as religion and anthropology.",

        "description": "In this landmark work, Richard Lazarus -- one of the world's foremost authorities -- offers a comprehensive treatment of the psychology of emotion, its role in adaptation, and the issues that must be addressed to understand it. The work provides a complete theory of emotional processes, explaining how different emotions are elicited and expressed, and how the emotional range of individuals develops over their lifetime. The author's approach puts emotion in a central role as a complex, patterned, organic reaction to both daily events and long-term efforts on the part of the individual to survive, flourish, and achieve. In his view, emotions cannot be divorced from other functions--whether biological, social, or cognitive--and express the intimate, personal meaning of what individuals experience. As coping and adapting processes, they are seen as part of the ongoing effort to monitor changes, stimuli, and stresses arising from the environment. After defining emotion and discussing issues of classification and measurement, Lazarus turns to the topics of motivation, cognition, and causality as key concepts in this theory. Next he looks at individual emotions, both negative and positive, and examines their development in terms of social influences and individual events. Finally, he considers the long-term consequences of emotion on physical health and well-being, and the treatment and prevention of emotional dysfunction. The book draws together the relevant research from a wide variety of sources, and distills the author's pioneering work in the field over the last forty years. As a comprehensive treatment of the emotions, the book will interest students, clinicians, and researchers involved in personality, social and clinical psychology, as well as cognitive and developmental psychology. It may also be used as a supplemental textbook in courses on the psychology of adjustment, emotion, and feeling.",

        "description": "Peter Goldie opens the path to a deeper understanding of our emotional lives through a lucid philosophical exploration of this surprisingly neglected topic. He illuminates the phenomena of emotion by drawing not only on philosophy but also on literature and science. He considers the roles of culture and evolution in the development of our emotional capabilities. He examines the links between emotion, mood, and character, and places the emotions in the context of such related phenomena as consciousness, thought, feeling, and imagination. He explains how it is that we are able to make sense of our own and other people's emotions, and how we can explain the very human things which emotions lead us to do. A key theme of The Emotions is the idea of a personal perspective or point of view, contrasted with the impersonal stance of the empirical sciences. Goldie argues that it is only from the personal point of view that thoughts, reasons, feelings, and actions come into view. He suggests that there is a tendency for philosophers to over-intellectualize the emotions, and investigates how far it is possible to explain emotions in terms of rationality. Over-intellectualizing can also involve neglecting the centrality of feelings, and Goldie shows how to put them where they belong, as part of the intentionality of emotional experience, directed towards the world from a point of view. Goldie argues that the various elements of emotional experience\u2014including thought, feeling, bodily change, and expression\u2014are tied together in a narrative structure. To make sense of one's emotional life one has to see it as part of a larger unfolding narrative. The narrative is not simply an interpretative framework of a life: it is what that life is. Goldie concludes by applying these ideas in a close study of one particular emotion: jealousy. This fascinating book gives an accessible but penetrating exploration of a subject that is important but mysterious to all of us. Any reader interested in emotion, and its role in our understanding of our lives, will find much to think about here.",

        "description": "Based upon lectures presented at an invitational colloquium in honor of Nico Frijda, this collection of essays represents a brief and up-to-date overview of the field of emotions, their significance and how they function. For most, emotions are simply what we feel, giving our lives affective value. Scientists approach emotions differently -- some considering the \"feeling\" aspect to be of little relevance to their research questions. Some investigators consider emotions from a phenomenological perspective, while others believe that the psychophysiological bases of the emotions are of prime importance, and still others observe and study animals in order to generate hypotheses about human emotions. Containing essays which represent each of these approaches, this book is in one sense a heterogenous collection. Nevertheless, the variety of approaches and interests come together, since these scholars are all operating from a more or less cognitive psychological orientation and use the same conceptual reference scheme. Written by experts in their own area, the essays reflect the richness of research in emotions. Whether these approaches and opinions can be harmonized into a single theory of emotions is a question which the future will have to answer.",

        "description": "This book showcases new research and theory about the way in which the social environment shapes, and is shaped by, emotion. The book has three sections, each of which addresses a different level of sociality: interpersonal, intragroup, and intergroup. The first section refers to the links between specific individuals, the second to categories that define multiple individuals as an entity, and the final to the boundaries between groups. Emotions are found in each of these levels and the dynamics involved in these types of relationship are part of what it is to experience emotion. The chapters show how all three types of social relationships generate, and are generated by, emotions. In doing so, this book locates emotional experiences in the larger social context.",

        "description": "Creativity is a way of thinking, of looking at things, of experiencing, and operating. Although creativity may seem magical, a rare talent of a select few, creativity is, in fact, available to everyone. In Cultivating Creativity, you will learn how to unlock your creative potential and develop your creative expression. Through developing your creativity, you will become better at generating ideas and finding new perspectives. But, more importantly, with creativity, you will improve your capability to rise to the moment, to make the most of the potentials and demands of the present, and facilitate your ability to lead a full and rich life. In Cultivating Creativity, you will learn many ways to foster your creative process and expression, including: * Have Belief - When you think something is possible, it almost certainly is...especially good ideas. * Research - Explore and lay the groundwork and understanding in subject areas to provide a richer substrate for ideas to grow. * Flow - Let ideas come to you naturally around a specific topic or topics. The more you spark your creativity, the brighter it will burn. * Get out of your way - Learn how to let creativity happen. Be present, mindful, and creative. * Nurture Dreams - Using the right approach, let going to sleep and dreaming lead to a wealth of new ideas. * Be Flexible and Play - Learn to toy with and manipulate ideas and concepts, examining them from different angles and views, critical components of creative insight. * Have Conversations - Indulge in engaged and informed discussion and debate, as powerful sources of new ideas. * Relax - Let the mind generate ideas while you watch and guide the process. Or be mindless and let them come to you. * Change Things Up - If you're stuck in a rut, do something different! Recharge for new ideas. * Be Passionate - Find what most excites and motivates you about a topic or idea and see where this interest leads. * Have Internal Dialogue - If you love exciting, intellectual interplay with friends, family members, and co-workers, why not have one with yourself? * Adjust Your State of Mind - Let new thoughts and ideas emerge naturally by learning to change your consciousness, your perspective, and how you feel. Experience events in new ways. * Instigate Thought Experiments - Consciously explore new ways to look at and think about problems, concepts, and events, leading to new creative insights. * Act Ridiculous - Get out of your comfort zone and put the bounds of normalcy and convention aside to look at things in new ways. * Be Present - Being present helps fully appreciate and engage the moment and open yourself to creative possibility. Taken singly or in combination, switched or applied consistently, these approaches will help foster and develop your creativity, nurturing your ability to react to and generate many possible responses to the moment. And, with greater possibilities in each moment and more positive outcomes, comes the potential for greater rewards and a richer life. Choose creativity and begin creating!",

It comprises the negative, disruptive elements, which threaten to undermine and even destroy the group, but when contained, have the potential to mobilise the group's creative processes. Understanding the 'anti-group' gives therapists new perspectives on the nature of relationships and alternative strategies for managing destructive behaviour.",

It also brings together writers who have studied creative thinkers in different areas, such as the various arts, sciences, and communication/leadership. Each contributor explains what is known about the cognitive processes, ways of conceptualizing and solving problems, personality and motivational attributes, guiding metaphors, and work habits or styles that best characterize creative people within the domain he or she has investigated. In addition, this book features: *an examination of how creativity is similar and different in diverse domains; *chapters written by an expert on creativity in the domain about which he or she is writing; *a chapter on creativity in psychology which examines patterns of performance leading to creative eminence in different areas of psychology; and *a final chapter proposing a new theory of creativity--the Amusement Park Theoretical Model. This book appeals to creativity researchers and students of creativity; cognitive, education, social, and developmental psychologists; and educated laypeople interested in exploring their own creativity.",

        "description": "Nurturing Creativity in the Classroom is a groundbreaking collection of essays by leading scholars, who examine and respond to the tension that many educators face in valuing student creativity but believing that they cannot support it given the curricular constraints of the classroom. Is it possible for teachers to nurture creative development and expression without drifting into curricular chaos? Do curricular constraints necessarily lead to choosing conformity over creativity? This book combines the perspectives of top educators and psychologists to generate practical advice for considering and addressing the challenges of supporting creativity within the classroom. It is unique in its balance of practical recommendations for nurturing creativity and thoughtful appreciation of curricular constraints. This approach helps ensure that the insights and advice found in this collection will take root in educators' practice, rather than being construed as yet another demand placed on their overflowing plate of responsibilities.",

Rather than simply herald disruption, Karen Nelson-Field starts an intelligent conversation on what it will take for businesses to win in an attention economy, the advertising myths we need to leave behind and the scientific evidence we can use to navigate a complex advertising and media ecosystem. This book makes sense of viewability standards, coverage and clutter; it talks about the real quality behind a qCPM and takes a deep dive into the relationship between attention and sales. It explains the stark reality of human attention processing in advertising. Readers will learn how to maximise a viewer\u2019s divided attention by leveraging specific media attributes and using attention-grabbing creative triggers. Nelson-Field asks you to pay attention to a disrupted advertising future without panic, but rather with a keen eye on the things that brand owners can learn to control.",

        "description": "Mathematical models can be classified in a number of ways, e.g., static and dynamic; deterministic and stochastic; linear and nonlinear; individual and aggregate; descriptive, predictive, and normative; according to the mathematical technique applied or according to the problem area in which they are used. In marketing, the level of sophistication of the mathe matical models varies considerably, so that a nurnber of models will be meaningful to a marketing specialist without an extensive mathematical background. To make it easier for the nontechnical user we have chosen to classify the models included in this collection according to the major marketing problem areas in which they are applied. Since the emphasis lies on mathematical models, we shall not as a rule present statistical models, flow chart models, computer models, or the empirical testing aspects of these theories. We have also excluded competitive bidding, inventory and transportation models since these areas do not form the core of \u00b7the marketing field.",

The successful use of case studies in business schools shows the superior outcomes of an interdisciplinary approach to problem solving. Disappointingly, functional departmental silos within universities still exist and keep problem solvers from seeing all the effects of a given issue. In addition to providing teaching material, Decision Making in Marketing and Finance provides motives and strategies to break down functional silos in making informed and effective business and finance decisions. Koku achieves his goal by showing how value can be created for shareholders and other stakeholders, linking marketing and finance decision making, and providing much-needed teaching materials for an interdisciplinary approach to case analysis.",

The workshop was organized by the editors of the proceedings volume. The proceedings contain both \"full papers\" and shorter pieces, to be considered as \"work in progress\". The choice of a rather broad theme for the workshop was deliberate and done in order to attract researchers from different areas of the marketing science community that usually do not get together. Obviously, a volume like this cannot be exhaustive in the coverage of the dynamics of marketing competition but we are confident that it will convey to the reader an impression of what are the current themes in this field of research. The book should be useful to researchers in marketing science, applied game theorists, graduate students, as well as practitioners in marketing with an interest in methods and examples of dynamic competitive analysis.",

        "description": "Divergence: A Source of Creative Thinking The outstanding job accomplished by Bernard, Gary, and Gilles is really praiseworthy: not only did they succeed in completing within a remark ably short span of time the editing of the contributions to the conference that marked the 20th Anniversary of the European Institute for Ad vanced Studies in Management; they have also managed to elicit numerous insightful comments from a host of dashing young scholars as well as from the fortunate few established authorities whose findings have long be come leading articles in the best academic journals, who now chair those journals' editorial boards, and after whom great scientific awards have been named. In so doing, our dedicated triumvirate has blended together pieces of diverse research traditions-some of them quite puzzling-and mixed significantly differentiated styles of expression. The controversial display of self-confidence by some distinguished colleagues, the amazingly emo tional \"good old\" memories revived by their peers, the scapegoat-finding and moralizing confessions produced by some of their disciples together with the detached systematic rigidity of some others all combine to pro duce a multivarious patchwork that may well prove the existence of a marketing scholar lifecycle. This cartoon-like four-class typology might even make it worth the reader's while to indulge in some guesswork to discover the sequence of the four stages as an exercise and then partition the author population accordingly.",

        "description": "Marketing models is a core component of the marketing discipline. The recent developments in marketing models have been incredibly fast with information technology (e.g., the Internet), online marketing (e-commerce) and customer relationship management (CRM) creating radical changes in the way companies interact with their customers. This has created completely new breeds of marketing models, but major progress has also taken place in existing types of marketing models. The HANDBOOK OF MARKETING DECISION MODELS presents the state of the art in marketing decision models, dealing with new modeling areas such as customer relationship management, customer value and online marketing, but also describes recent developments in other areas. In the category of marketing mix models, the latest models for advertising, sales promotions, sales management, and competition are dealt with. New developments are presented in consumer decision models, models for return on marketing, marketing management support systems, and in special techniques such as time series and neural nets. Not only are the most recent models discussed, but the book also pays attention to the implementation of marketing models in companies and to applications in specific industries.",

        "description": "From June 1775 to February 1781, during the American War of Independence, ten patriot generals died as a result of combat wounds. Their service and deaths spanned most of the war\u00c6s duration and geographical expanse. The generals were a diverse group, with six born in America and four in Europe, three coming from professional military backgrounds, and the rest citizen-soldiers, mostly with limited military experience. As the colonists won their independence, the fallen generals became martyrs for the revolutionary ideals that would inspire later generations throughout the world. Liberty\u00c6s Fallen Generals is the first book to analyze these key military leaders\u00c6 service and the quality of their leadership in light of recent scholarship on the Revolutionary War. Each general\u00c6s profile provides background on military and political events leading to his emergence, assesses the general as a military leader in the war, and examines the campaign that culminated in his battle-related death. A compelling study in leadership and sacrifice, Liberty\u00c6s Fallen Generals is essential reading for those interested in learning more about America\u00c6s earliest heroes.",

Why was the startling success of his campaigns in Poland and France followed by the blundering mistakes in Russia, North Africa and France? Might Germany even have won the war without Hitler's continual and disastrous interference? In this extraordinary history, John Strawson answers these and other questions by showing how Hitler's insatiable preoccupation with war and conquest was translated into reality. While the power of a revitalized German army came from Hitler, Strawson examines the Fuhrer's eccentric use of the most formidable war machine the world had ever seen. This lucid story of fire and incompetence is brought alive by the accounts of those who served Hitler both on his staff and as field commanders. Perfect for readers of Ian Kershaw and Anthony Beevor.",

        "description": "\u201cAn expert account of Nazi war strategy that concludes that Hitler was not without military talent.\u201d(Kirkus Reviews) After Germany\u2019s humiliating World War II defeat, numerous German generals published memoirs claiming that their country\u2019s brilliant military leadership had been undermined by the F\u00fchrer\u2019s erratic decision making. The author of three highly acclaimed books on the era, Stephen Fritz upends this characterization of Hitler as an ill-informed fantasist and demonstrates the ways in which his strategy was coherent and even competent. That Hitler saw World War II as the only way to retrieve Germany\u2019s fortunes and build an expansionist Thousand-Year Reich is uncontroversial. But while his generals did sometimes object to Hitler\u2019s tactics and operational direction, they often made the same errors in judgment and were in agreement regarding larger strategic and political goals. A necessary volume for understanding the influence of World War I on Hitler\u2019s thinking, this work is also an eye-opening reappraisal of major events like the invasion of Russia and the battle for Normandy. \u201cPerhaps the best account we have to date of Hitler\u2019s military leadership. It shows a scrupulous and imaginative historian at work and will cement Fritz\u2019s reputation as one of the leading historians of the military conflicts generated by Hitler\u2019s Germany.\u201d \u2014Richard Overy, author of The Bombing War \u201cOriginal, insightful and authoritative.\u201d \u2014David Stahel, author of The Battle for Moscow",

        "description": "Although not nearly as well known as other U.S. Army senior commanders, General Mark Clark is one of the four men\u00d1along with Eisenhower, Patton, and Bradley\u00d1who historian Martin Blumenson called \u00d2the essential quartet of American leaders who achieved victory in Europe.\u00d3 Eisenhower nicknamed him the American Eagle. A skilled staff officer, Clark rose quickly through the ranks, and by the time America entered the war he was deputy commander of Allied Forces in North Africa. Several weeks before Operation Torch, Clark landed by submarine in a daring mission to negotiate the cooperation of the Vichy French. He was subsequently named commander of U.S. Fifth Army and tasked with the invasion of Italy. Fifth Army and Mark Clark are virtually synonymous. From the September 1943 landing at Salerno, Clark and his army fought their way north against skilled German resistance, augmented by mountainous terrain. The daring January 1944 end-run at Anzio, although not immediately successful, set the stage for Fifth Army\u00d5s liberation of Rome on 4 June 1944, after ten months of hard fighting. The war in Italy was not over, but the taking of Rome intact was a tremendous achievement. Pitted against one of Hitler\u00d5s most able commanders, Field Marshal Albert Kesselring, Fifth Army spent another ten months in ferocious combat from the Gothic Line to the Po Valley, as Clark moved up to head all Allied ground forces in Italy as commander of 15th Army Group. The brutal Italian Campaign has been long overshadowed by D-Day and the campaign across France and into Germany. Likewise, the senior U.S. commander in Italy has been largely overlooked when one thinks of the great captains of the war. The author, Mikolashek remedies this situation, shedding much needed historical light on one of America\u00d5s most important fighting generals in this \u00d2warts and all\u00d3 biography. It also demonstrates the importance of the Italian Campaign, paying tribute to the valorous soldiers of U.S. Fifth Army and their Allied comrades. Jon Mikolashek is a history professor at the U.S Army Command and General Staff College branch at Ft. Belvoir, VA, and also teaches history at American Military University.",

At Moscow, Leningrad, Stalingrad, Kursk and Berlin\u2014as well as virtually all the principal battles on the Eastern Front during the Second World War\u2014Georgy Zhukov played a major role.

        "description": "On July 11, 1943, General Lucian Truscott received the Army's second-highest decoration, the Distinguished Service Cross, for valor in action in Sicily. During his career he also received the Army Distinguished Service Medal with Oak Leaf Cluster, the Navy Distinguished Service Medal, the Legion of Merit, and the Purple Heart. Truscott was one of the most significant of all U.S. Army generals in World War II, pioneering new combat training methods\u2014including the famous \u201cTruscott Trot\u201d\u2014 and excelling as a combat commander, turning the Third Infantry Division into one of the finest divisions in the U.S. Army. He was instrumental in winning many of the most important battles of the war, participating in the invasions of North Africa, Sicily, Anzio, and southern France. Truscott was not only respected by his peers and \u201cdogfaces\u201d\u2014common soldiers\u2014alike but also ranked by President Eisenhower as second only to Patton, whose command he took over on October 8, 1945, and led until April 1946. Yet no definitive history of his life has been compiled. Wilson Heefner corrects that with the first authoritative biography of this distinguished American military leader. Heefner has undertaken impressive research in primary sources\u2014as well as interviews with family members and former associates\u2014to shed new light on this overlooked hero. He presents Truscott as a soldier who was shaped by his upbringing, civilian and military education, family life, friendships, and evolving experiences as a commander both in and out of combat. Heefner\u2019s brisk narrative explores Truscott\u2019s career through his three decades in the Army and defines his roles in key operations. It also examines Truscott\u2019s postwar role as military governor of Bavaria, particularly in improving living conditions for Jewish displaced persons, removing Nazis from civil government, and assisting in the trials of German war criminals. And it offers the first comprehensive examination of his subsequent career in the Central Intelligence Agency, where he served as senior CIA representative in West Germany during the early days of the Cold War, and later as CIA Director Allen Dulles\u2019s deputy director for coordination in Washington. Dogface Soldier is a portrait of a man who earned a reputation for being honest, forthright, fearless, and aggressive, both as a military officer and in his personal life\u2014a man who, at the dedication ceremony for the Anzio-Nettuno American cemetery in 1945, turned away from the crowd and to the thousands of crosses stretching before him to address those buried there. Heefner has written a definitive biography of a great soldier and patriot.",

        "description": "In Social Movements: A Theoretical Approach, Dieter Rucht offers a theoretically and historically informed approach to social movements as a phenomenon of modern societies. He links the analysis of social movements to general theories of society and processes of social change, and combines three basic perspectives: interactionist, constructivist, and process-oriented (ICP-approach). Drawing mainly on ideas from J\u00fcrgen Habermas, Pierre Bourdieu, and Anthony Giddens, Rucht recommends several revisions and highlights the important role of the public sphere as the central stage for social movements. He argues that it is a realm in its own right and the major domain in which social movements make themselves seen and heard, garner support, and possibly succeed in changing basic societal structures. This comprehensive treatise analyzes the external and internal activities of social movements, the role of different kinds of opportunities and restrictions, collective identities and framing, organizing, networking, and strategizing. It lucidly examines the complexity of social movements that have a status as both actors and systems, and whose logic cannot be reduced to either strategic or communicative action.",

        "description": "This handbook covers social movement activities in Latin American countries that have had profound consequences on the political culture of the region. It examines the developments of the past twenty years, such as a renewed upswing in popular mobilization, the ending of violent conflicts and military governments, new struggles and a relatively more democratic climate. It shows that, from southern Chiapas to Argentina, social movements in the 1990s and especially in the 2000s, have reached new heights of popular participation. There is a lack of research on the politics of this region in the contemporary era of globalization, this volume partially fills the void and offers a rich resource to students, scholars and the general public in terms of understanding the politics of mass mobilization in the early twenty-first century. The contributors each address social movement activity in their own nation and together they present a multidisciplinary perspective on the topic. Each chapter uses a case study design to bring out the most prominent attributes of the particular social struggle(s), for instance the main protagonists in the campaigns, the grievances of the population and the outcomes of the struggles. This Handbook is divided into seven substantive themes, providing overall coherence to a broad range of social conflicts across countries, issues and social groups. These themes include: 1) theory of Latin American social movements; 2) neoliberalism; 3) indigenous struggles; 4) women\u2019s movements; 5) movements and the State; 6) environmental movements; and 7) transnational mobilizations.",

        "description": "This Open Access book explores the role of morality in social movements. Morality has always been central to social movements whether it be in the form of the moral foundations of movement claims, politics and ideologies, the values motivating participation, the new moral principles envisioned and practiced among movement participants, or the overall struggle over society\u2019s moral values that movements engage in. This is evident in movements emerging from recent interlinked crises: the crisis of human rights, the climate crisis, and the developing crisis of democracy. In analyzing these current events through a variety of theoretical, methodological, and empirical lenses, this book brings morality to the forefront of the discussion, allowing for a rethinking of its role. The book is divided into five parts. The first part introduces and explores the central concept of the book, outlining the dominant existing approaches to morality and ethics in the extant movement and civil society literature. The following three parts investigate morality in relation to topics and movements that are either prominent to contemporary politics or salient to the question of morality. In these empirically informed parts, the authors apply a diverse selection of methods spanning fieldwork, historiography, traditional and novel statistical analytical methods, and big data analysis to a diverse selection of data. Topics discussed include refugee solidarity movements, male privilege and anti-feminism movement, environmental and climate justice movements, and religious activism. The fifth and closing part of the book focuses on the more abstract theoretical question of the relationship between morality and ethics and activist practices and points to future research agendas. This book will be of general interest to students, scholars and academics within the disciplines of political sociology, -science and -anthropology and of particular interest to academics in the subfields of social movement and civil society studies.",

        "description": "This edited collection examines the multi-faceted phenomenon of transparency, especially in its relation to social movements, from a range of multi-disciplinary viewpoints. Over the past few decades, transparency has become an omnipresent catch phrase in public and scientific debates. The volume tracks developments of ideas and practices of transparency from the eighteenth century to the current day, as well as their semantic, cultural and social preconditions. It connects analyses of the ideological implications of transparency concepts and transparency claims with their impact on the public sphere in general and on social movements in particular. In doing so, the book contributes to a better understanding of social conflicts and power relations in modern societies. The chapters are organized into four parts, covering the concept and ideology of transparency, historical and recent developments of the public sphere and media, the role of the state as an agent of surveillance, and conflicts over transparency and participation connected to social movements.",

        "description": "The Men\u2019s Rights Movement consists of groups or individuals fighting for improved human rights for men. The movement is sometimes referred to as the Men\u2019s Human Rights Movement (MHRM), with human rights serving as a central focus that encompasses the same rights called civil liberties or civil rights but also including those rights that are not encoded in law - such as compassionate and respectful behavior toward men and indeed toward all human beings. The purpose of the movement has occasionally been misunderstood, this partly because it has been poorly documented. To correct that oversight this book attempts to provide a brief overview of both the historical beginnings and goals of the movement over the last 150 years. A historical survey reveals that the MRM is concerned with a large array of issues impacting men and boys such as alimony, genital mutilation of male infants, male homelessness, mental illness, false accusations, family court bias, suicide, child custody, low funding for male health issues, educational performance, and misandry in mainstream culture just to name a few. The following pages provide examples of the early MRM in action, focusing in Parts 1 \u2013 3 on the rise of men\u2019s advocacy in the 1800s. Part four provides a sample list of men\u2019s rights initiatives from the 1800s to recent times, and Part five provides a few personal and co-authored essays penned between the years 2012 \u2013 2017 that give a taste of contemporary thinking, with the concluding essay by Robert Brockway giving a general overview of concerns of the modern MRM. With the publication of this material in one volume it is hoped that the historical footprint of the MRM will be set straight.",

        "description": "Sociology is becoming fragmented. With specialised fields spinning off beyond the capacity of a unifying theoretical frame to embrace them, the prospect exists that sociology's vital centre may not hold. Proceeding from a social constructionist perspective, this work examines the existence and probes the origins of the specialised sociological fields of social problems and social movements. Conceptual ambiguities that currently plague both specialisations are noted, as are their effective theoretical isolation from general sociological theory. Each field is traced to its roots in sociology's formative period in the nineteenth century. Two modes of doing sociology are found to have evolved, respectively, in the United Stales and in Continental Europe, each conditioned by distinctive historical experiences and resonating with the prevailing social and political concerns on the two continents. American sociology emerged in response to social perceptions that progress is inhibited by a proliferation of 'social problems'. Continental European sociology arose in reaction to Enlightenment principles failing to be institutionalised, inviting the perceived social threat of either revolution or anarchy. Both sociologies are thus seen as ideologically contaminated, and their respective dominant perspectives, through the 1950s, are contrasted as the 'social problem orientation' and the 'social movement orientation'. Comparative analysis of these orientatations probes such issues as ahistorical vs. historical treatments: methodological individualism vs. collectivism: differential conceptions of class; the discipline's need to inhibit ideological contagion through a sociological reconstruction of prevailing social constructions of reality; the vital distinction between structural and processual conceptualisations. The study concludes that temporality serves as a crucial but much-neglected dimension in much of American sociology. So-called social problems and social movements are found to be grounded in essentially similar empirical social circumstances, with their alternate conceptualisations attributable to differential time-frames through which such circumstances are sociologically apprehended. This points to the potential theoretical integration of these two fields. Scientific, ideological. and social policy implications of alternative constructions of reality are also explored.",

Dynamical models represent a general and flexible approach to cognitive modeling. This introduction focuses on applications of stochastic processes and dynamical systems to model cognition. The dynamical approach is particularly useful to emphasize the strong link between experimental research (and its paradigms), data analysis, and mathematical models including their computer implementation for numerical simulation. Most of specific examples are from the domain of eye movement research, with concepts being applicable to a broad range of problems in cognitive modeling. The textbook aims at the graduate and/or advanced undergraduate level for students in Cognitive Science and related disciplines such as Psychology and Computer Science. Joint introduction of the theory of cognitive processes and mathematical models, their underlying mathematical concepts, numerical simulation, and analysis; The focus on eye movements provide a theoretically coherent, but very general application area; Computer code in R Programming Language for Statistical Computing is available for all examples, figures, and solutions to exercises.",

        "description": "With the rapid globalization of higher education as well as related changes in social, political, economic, and other conditions over the last 25 years there have been ever increasing expectations for higher education, in general, and Engineering Education, in particular. These expectations are often expressed in terms of the need for Quality Assurance locally, regionally, and globally. In some cases, there is a long tradition of independence and self-regulation of higher education institutions and programs. In other contexts, there has been c- siderable governmental regulation and disciplinary direction over time. The authors in this volume represent essentially all continents and 15 different countries. The common issues that they raise and their accounts of past, present, and future ch- lenges provide a snapshot of the current state of Quality Assurance in higher edu- tion and Engineering Education. This volume begins with an overview of the history and background of Quality Assurance in higher education and Engineering Education over the last century. The discussion of the historical, philosophical, political, and social background of Quality Assurance sets the stage for the other chapters. Following this broad brush stoke introduction, in the next part of the book, authors describe the general issues and challenges facing Quality Assurance in the twenty-first century from both regional and national perspectives. These authors have extensive experience in the area of Quality Assurance and have observed its growth and develop first hand over many years.",

        "description": "This co-edited volume compares Chinese and Western experiences of engineering, technology, and development. In doing so, it builds a bridge between the East and West and advances a dialogue in the philosophy of engineering. Divided into three parts, the book starts with studies on epistemological and ontological issues, with a special focus on engineering design, creativity, management, feasibility, and sustainability. Part II considers relationships between the history and philosophy of engineering, and includes a general argument for the necessity of dialogue between history and philosophy. It continues with a general introduction to traditional Chinese attitudes toward engineering and technology, and philosophical case studies of the Chinese steel industry, railroads, and cybernetics in the Soviet Union. Part III focuses on engineering, ethics, and society, with chapters on engineering education and practice in China and the West. The book\u2019s analyses of the interactions of science, engineering, ethics, politics, and policy in different societal contexts are of special interest. The volume as a whole marks a new stage in the emergence of the philosophy of engineering as a new regionalization of philosophy. This carefully edited interdisciplinary volume grew out of an international conference on the philosophy of engineering hosted by the University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing. It includes 30 contributions by leading philosophers, social scientists, and engineers from Australia, China, Europe, and the United States.",

Alternative conflict resolution mechanisms are nothing new to the country: arbitration as a dispute settlement mechanism by which a third party issues a binding decision on a dispute between two or more parties by exercising the jurisdictional mandate conferred on it by the parties themselves was established with the adoption of the Civil Code in 1960. This pioneering book evaluates the extent to which Ethiopia\u2019s laws and institutions allow disputing parties to effectively reap the benefits of international commercial arbitration. It interprets the relevant legislation and attempts to bridge the gaps in it, in order to help lawyers, arbitrators, arbitral institutions, academics and judges to understand and apply it. It also helps parties seeking to complete international transactions pertaining to Ethiopia make the right choice regarding conflict resolution.",

        "description": "This book brings together articles from leading experts in the field of international dispute resolution. The main focus is on the situation in Asia, though the European perspective also plays an important part. Accordingly, the focus on the Asian dispute resolution market with a distinctly American and European \u201ctouch\u201d is one of the book\u2019s most unique features. The dispute resolution market is rapidly transforming, and dispute resolution law is changing with it \u2013especially in Asia. This book highlights recent advances and outlines future trends in this area. Emphasis is especially placed on International Commercial Arbitration Law on the one hand; and on International Investment Arbitration Law on the other. Two dedicated sections address these two topics, while another is dedicated to a quite new phenomenon in the field of international dispute resolution, the emergence of International Commercial Courts not only in Asia, but also in other regions of the world (e.g. in the Netherlands). This raises a host of interesting legal questions, which the book addresses. The book\u2019s final section investigates general trends in dispute resolution (e.g. the rising cost problem in arbitration in general).",

        "description": "In the last decade, disputes between developers and local commu nities over proposed construction projects have led to increasing litiga tion. Environmental legislation, in particular, has greatly enhanced the rights and powers of organized groups that desire to participate in local development decisions. These powers have allowed citizen groups to block undesired and socially unacceptable projects, such as highways through urban areas and sprawling suburban developments. At the same time, these powers have produced a collective inability to construct many needed projects that produce adverse local impacts. Prisons, airports, hos pitals, waste treatment plants, and energy facilities all face years of liti gation before a final decision. At times, prolonged litigation has pro duced especially high costs to all participants. Despite these new powers, citizen action has often been limited to participation in public hearings or adjudicatory proceedings. Typically, this occurs so late in the decision process that citizen input has very little affect in shaping a project's design. Those who dislike some element of a project often have little choice other than to oppose the entire project through litigation.",

This Encyclopedia offers students and scholars access to information about the concepts, institutions/organizations, events, and individuals that have shaped the history of economics, business, and labor from the origins of what became the United States in an earlier age of globalization and the expansion of capitalism to the present. It includes entries that explore the changing character of capitalism from the seventeenth century to the present; the evolution of business practices and organizations; describe changes in the labor force as legally free workers replaced a labor force dominated by slaves and indentures; treat the means by which workers sought to better their lives; and that deal with government policies and practices that affected economic activities, business developments, and the lives of working people. This Encyclopedia includes readily at hand information about key economic concepts and theories, major economists, diverse sectors of the economy, the history of economic and financial crises, major business organizations and their founders, labor organizations and their leaders, and specific government policies and judicial rulings that have shaped US economic and labor history as well as guides to the best and most recent scholarly works related to the subject covered by each entry. Because of the broad chronological span covered by the encyclopedia and the breadth of its subjects, it will interest history students, economics majors, school of business entrants as well as to those studying public policy and administration.",

        "description": "In recent years mediation has become an increasingly popular approach and powerful technique and has been used successfully in such areas as commercial disputes and customer complaints-handling. Here, for the first time, is an accessible and practical book on mediation at work and in the workplace itself. Packed with real-life examples and cases, it focuses on mediation's positive way of looking at conflict, how it injects a new dimension into people's 'conflict zone', and outlines the qualities needed to be a mediating manager. Mediating managers become beacons of positive energy perceived as people capable of holding things together when others are 'losing it'. They are able to do this because they are enablers, not judge and jury, catalysts not fixers, encouragers not enforcers. Mapping out the overall steps of the mediation process, what mediating managers' core tasks are at each stage, the opportunities offered to those involved, and illustrating different key moments of effectively resolved workplace disputes, the book demonstrates how transferable mediation skills are and how they can be used in a wide range of workplace settings.",

        "description": "This book covers the main topics that students need to learn in a course on Industrial Organization. It reviews the classic models and important empirical evidence related to the field. However, it will differ from prior textbooks in two ways. First, this book incorporates contributions from behavioral economics and neuroeconomics, providing the reader with a richer understanding of consumer preferences and the motivation for many of the business practices we see today. The book discusses how firms exploit consumers who are prone to making mistakes and who suffer from cognitive dissonance, attention lapses, and bounded rationality, for example and will help explain why firms invest in persuasive advertising, offer 30-day free trials, offer money-back guarantees, and engage in other observed phenomena that cannot be explained by the traditional approaches to industrial organization. A second difference is that this book achieves a balance between textbooks that emphasize formal modeling and those that emphasize the history of the field, empirical evidence, case studies, and policy analysis. This text puts more emphasis on the micro-foundations (i.e., consumer and producer theory), classic game theoretic models, and recent contributions from behavioral economics that are pertinent to industrial organization. Each topic will begin with a discussion of relevant theory and models and will also include a discussion of concrete examples, empirical evidence, and evidence from case studies. This will provide students with a deeper understanding of firm and consumer behavior, of the factors that influence market structure and economic performance, and of policy issues involving imperfectly competitive markets. The book is intended to be a textbook for graduate students, MBAs and upper-level undergraduates and will use examples, graphical analysis, algebra, and simple calculus to explain important ideas and theories in industrial organization.",

        "description": "This book adopts the decision theoretic viewpoint in the organization design problems in management and organization theory. The first part considers a short-run adaptive process in the organization. The organization design is represented by a combination of the organization structure and the management system and constitutes a part of the sequential decision problem of the work. The second part considers the long-run adaptive process for modifying and improving the work. This process is formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process. The final part restates the theoretical results of the previous two parts as normative propositions on the efficient organization design. To test these propositions, the study focusses on the organization structures and the management systems of Japanese firms and obtains the data which support the author's theoretical propositions. This book provides a useful normative approach to organization design problems in management and organization theory.",

Examples include working from home, shortened work days and/or weeks, and taking on responsibilities not enumerated in the job description. I-deals fulfil unique employee needs that lay outside the employer\u2019s standard offerings, and engender a wide range of positive outcomes for both parties, such as employee well-being, work-life balance, career development, and enhanced job performance and citizenship behaviors. I-deals have the potential to be a strategic HR device for addressing the changing needs and preferences of employees, employers, and the wider society in the post-pandemic era. This new collection provides a holistic, integrated and interdisciplinary overview of i-deals from leading scholars in the area. In addressing topics such as the sociological impact of i-deals, issues of power, privilege and fairness, and HR differentiation, this volume examines i-deals at the individual, team, organizational, and societal levels. The book will be useful to scholars and practitioners alike by offering a nuanced understanding of i-deals in workgroup settings, extending research on this relevant topic, and offering managerial prescriptions for institutionalizing i-deals as a global strategic human resource management device.",

        "description": "This book helps undergraduate and graduate students understand Chester Barnard\u2019s organization theory. Barnard\u2019s book The Functions of the Executive is a classic that, along with Herbert Simon\u2019s Administrative Behavior, is often considered to be essential reading for management students. However, it is well known to be difficult and abstract. Offering a systematic overview, this book provides an excellent introduction to Barnard\u2019s organization theory. Chester Barnard\u2019s concept of formal organization is often cited as a definitive opus on the subject of organization. However, he provided other concepts of organization, such as cooperative systems, complex formal organizations, and informal organizations. In his second book, Organization and Management, he added two more concepts, lateral organizations and status systems, allowing researchers to gain a better understanding of how Barnard developed his organization theory after his first publication. Barnard was a successful practitioner as well as a theorist, and his organization theory is full of practical insights gained from managing various types of organizations, including NGOs and NPOs. This book discusses how Barnard\u2019s organization theory can be applied to business practices in the context of exploring a new style of management, and provides suggestions for business people seeking innovations for their own organizations.",

As a rather pleasant storyteller and essayist, Hawthorne uses good humor, good sense, good taste, and thoughtful morality for young readership to relay humorous historical and biographical accounts of history. Young readers are sure to follow along as the witty author chronicles the history of New England, as well as some indiscriminate histories of Great Britain in relation to America.",

        "description": "Biography has been around at least since the time of Christ, but it was not called that until the late seventeenth century, and even then it was conflated with other terms to describe essentially the same activity. Developed over centuries there has been surprisingly little systematical theoretical work done on the genre of biography. Not only does this text serve as a historical primer on biography it provides a touchstone text on the theories behind the phrase, why it became prominent, and whether or not it can be critically analyzed as a historiographical and literary genre. Whether Biography is a genuine academic genre has long been a nagging question. These days no serious scholar can deny its place in the Humanities. It is omnipresent as a genre, and narrative tradition in the study of the history and interpretation of human lives. However, the field of Biography Studies seems scattered and insecure. Specifically the connections between Biography and History, Microhistory and Life Writing are being discussed. The selected authors have taken up positions in this current debate by means of exploratory but programmatic texts. The volume includes an introduction and contribution by Nigel Hamilton, an award winning biographer and biography scholar.",

        "description": "The writing of lives is part of a long, scholarly tradition and has been seen variously as a sub-branch of history, literature, and cultural studies. Auto/biography has been used in educational studies to bring understanding to the historical conditions of educational actors, whether students, teachers, parents, or policy makers. It has been used as a research tool to explore experiences of schooling and its impact on future lives as well as to identify patterns in teachers' perceptions. The authors have set two main points for this book about auto/biography and education. First, they set out to investigate comprehensively the uses of auto/biography, including its benefits and dangers. Second, they seek to explore how one can judge the value of using biography and auto/biography as historical and cultural sources for education. In doing so, they offer guidance on how to analyze texts, helping the reader to develop a more nuanced and complex understanding of people's stories. Unlike others in this area, this book draws on writings in a variety of disciplines, including psychology, literature, education, women's studies, and the philosophy of history. This book will be of particular interest to graduate students and researchers in education, the social sciences, and the humanities. It will be attractive to an international audience, especially because of the authors' affiliations with a variety of institutions in the United States, Canada, and Europe.",

Myers, who states in the preface, \u201cTo compile and issue a work of this kind that would be perfect, has been my particular aim, and, I believe that I have succeeded.\u201d Myers confirms that \u201ceach and every\u201d recipe has been \u201ccarefully analyzed and tested by me\u201d to ensure the highest of quality. Furthermore, Myers also states that the recipes were designed to only use quantities and ingredients absolutely necessary, and because of this, will save readers significant money.

        "description": "The Inspector-General is a national institution. To place a purely literary valuation upon it and call it the greatest of Russian comedies would not convey the significance of its position either in Russian literature or in Russian life itself. There is no other single work in the modern literature of any language that carries with it the wealth of associations which the Inspector-General does to the educated Russian. The Germans have their Faust; but Faust is a tragedy with a cosmic philosophic theme. In England it takes nearly all that is implied in the comprehensive name of Shakespeare to give the same sense of bigness that a Russian gets from the mention of the Revizor.",

The witty play was later used as the basis for a movie version starring Danny Kaye (1949).",

        "description": "This volume does not aim to contain all \u201cthe best American humorous short stories\u201d; there are many other stories equally as good, I suppose, in much the same vein, scattered through the range of American literature. I have tried to keep a certain unity of aim and impression in selecting these stories. In the first place I determined that the pieces of brief fiction which I included must first of all be not merely good stories, but good short stories. I put myself in the position of one who was about to select the best short stories in the whole range of American literature, but who, just before he started to do this, was notified that he must refrain from selecting any of the best American short stories that did not contain the element of humor to a marked degree. But I have kept in mind the wide boundaries of the term humor, and also the fact that the humorous standard should be kept second \u2014 although a close second \u2014 to the short story standard. In view of the necessary limitations as to the volume\u2019s size, I could not hope to represent all periods of American literature adequately, nor was this necessary in order to give examples of the best that has been done in the short story in a humorous vein in American literature. Probably all types of the short story of humor are included here, at any rate. Not only copyright restrictions but in a measure my own opinion have combined to exclude anything by Joel Chandler Harris \u2014 Uncle Remus \u2014 from the collection. Harris is primarily \u2014 in his best work \u2014 a humorist, and only secondarily a short story writer. As a humorist he is of the first rank; as a writer of short stories his place is hardly so high. His humor is not mere funniness and diversion; he is a humorist in the fundamental and large sense, as are Cervantes, Rabelais, and Mark Twain. No book is duller than a book of jokes, for what is refreshing in small doses becomes nauseating when perused in large assignments. Humor in literature is at its best not when served merely by itself but when presented along with other ingredients of literary force in order to give a wide representation of life. Therefore \u201cprofessional literary humorists,\u201d as they may be called, have not been much considered in making up this collection. In the history of American humor there are three names which stand out more prominently than all others before Mark Twain, who, however, also belongs to a wider classification: \u201cJosh Billings\u201d (Henry Wheeler Shaw, 1815\u20131885), \u201cPetroleum V. Nasby\u201d (David Ross Locke, 1833\u20131888), and \u201cArtemus Ward\u201d (Charles Farrar Browne, 1834\u20131867). In the history of American humor these names rank high; in the field of American literature and the American short story they do not rank so high. I have found nothing of theirs that was first-class both as humor and as short story. Perhaps just below these three should be mentioned George Horatio Derby (1823\u20131861), author of Phoenixiana (1855) and the Squibob Papers (1859), who wrote under the name \u201cJohn Phoenix.\u201d As has been justly said, \u201cDerby, Shaw, Locke and Browne carried to an extreme numerous tricks already invented by earlier American humorists, particularly the tricks of gigantic exaggeration and calm-faced mendacity, but they are plainly in the main channel of American humor, which had its origin in the first comments of settlers upon the conditions of the frontier, long drew its principal inspiration from the differences between that frontier and the more settled and compact regions of the country, and reached its highest development in Mark Twain, in his youth a child of the American frontier, admirer and imitator of Derby and Browne, and eventually a man of the world and one of its greatest humorists.\u201d Nor have such later writers who were essentially humorists as \u201cBill Nye\u201d (Edgar Wilson Nye, 1850\u20131896) been considered, because their work does not attain the literary standard and the short story standard as creditably as it does the humorous one. When we come to the close of the nineteenth century the work of such men as \u201cMr. Dooley\u201d (Finley Peter Dunne, 1867- ) and George Ade (1866- ) stands out. But while these two writers successfully conform to the exacting critical requirements of good humor and \u2014 especially the former \u2014 of good literature, neither \u2014 though Ade more so \u2014 attains to the greatest excellence of the short story. Mr. Dooley of the Archey Road is essentially a wholesome and wide-poised humorous philosopher, and the author of Fables in Slang is chiefly a satirist, whether in fable, play or what not. This volume might well have started with something by Washington Irving, I suppose many critics would say. It does not seem to me, however, that Irving\u2019s best short stories, such as The Legend of Sleepy Hollow and Rip Van Winkle, are essentially humorous stories, although they are o\u2019erspread with the genial light of reminiscence. It is the armchair geniality of the eighteenth century essayists, a constituent of the author rather than of his material and product. Irving\u2019s best humorous creations, indeed, are scarcely short stories at all, but rather essaylike sketches, or sketchlike essays. James Lawson (1799\u20131880) in his Tales and Sketches: by a Cosmopolite (1830), notably in The Dapper Gentleman\u2019s Story, is also plainly a follower of Irving. We come to a different vein in the work of such writers as William Tappan Thompson (1812\u20131882), author of the amusing stories in letter form, Major Jones\u2019s Courtship (1840); Johnson Jones Hooper (1815\u20131862), author of Widow Rugby\u2019s Husband, and Other Tales of Alabama (1851); Joseph G. Baldwin (1815\u20131864), who wrote The Flush Times of Alabama and Mississippi (1853); and Augustus Baldwin Longstreet (1790\u20131870), whose Georgia Scenes (1835) are as important in \u201clocal color\u201d as they are racy in humor. Yet none of these writers yield the excellent short story which is also a good piece of humorous literature. But they opened the way for the work of later writers who did attain these combined excellences. The sentimental vein of the midcentury is seen in the work of Seba Smith (1792\u20131868), Eliza Leslie (1787\u20131858), Frances Miriam Whitcher (\u201cWidow Bedott,\u201d 1811\u20131852), Mary W. Janvrin (1830\u20131870), and Alice Bradley Haven Neal (1828\u20131863). The well-known work of Joseph Clay Neal (1807\u20131847) is so all pervaded with caricature and humor that it belongs with the work of the professional humorist school rather than with the short story writers. To mention his Charcoal Sketches, or Scenes in a Metropolis (1837\u20131849) must suffice. The work of Seba Smith is sufficiently expressed in his title, Way Down East, or Portraitures of Yankee Life (1854), although his Letters of Major Jack Downing (1833) is better known. Of his single stories may be mentioned The General Court and Jane Andrews\u2019 Firkin of Butter (October, 1847, Graham\u2019s Magazine). The work of Frances Miriam Whitcher (\u201cWidow Bedott\u201d) is of somewhat finer grain, both as humor and in other literary qualities. Her stories or sketches, such as Aunt Magwire\u2019s Account of Parson Scrantum\u2019s Donation Party (March, 1848, Godey\u2019s Lady\u2019s Book) and Aunt Magwire\u2019s Account of the Mission to Muffletegawmy (July, 1859, Godey\u2019s), were afterwards collected in The Widow Bedott Papers (1855-56-80). The scope of the work of Mary B. Haven is sufficiently suggested by her story, Mrs. Bowen\u2019s Parlor and Spare Bedroom (February, 1860, Godey\u2019s), while the best stories of Mary W. Janvrin include The Foreign Count; or, High Art in Tattletown (October, 1860, Godey\u2019s) and City Relations; or, the Newmans\u2019 Summer at Clovernook (November, 1861, Godey\u2019s). The work of Alice Bradley Haven Neal is of somewhat similar texture. Her book, The Gossips of Rivertown, with Sketches in Prose and Verse (1850) indicates her field, as does the single title, The Third-Class Hotel (December, 1861, Godey\u2019s). Perhaps the most representative figure of this school is Eliza Leslie (1787\u20131858), who as \u201cMiss Leslie\u201d was one of the most frequent contributors to the magazines of the 1830\u2019s, 1840\u2019s and 1850\u2019s. One of her best stories is The Watkinson Evening (December, 1846, Godey\u2019s Lady\u2019s Book), included in the present volume; others are The Batson Cottage (November, 1846, Godey\u2019s Lady\u2019s Book) and Juliet Irwin; or, the Carriage People (June, 1847, Godey\u2019s Lady\u2019s Book). One of her chief collections of stories is Pencil Sketches (1833\u20131837). \u201cMiss Leslie,\u201d wrote Edgar Allan Poe, \u201cis celebrated for the homely naturalness of her stories and for the broad satire of her comic style.\u201d She was the editor of The Gift one of the best annuals of the time, and in that position perhaps exerted her chief influence on American literature When one has read three or four representative stories by these seven authors one can grasp them all. Their titles as a rule strike the keynote. These writers, except \u201cthe Widow Bedott,\u201d are perhaps sentimentalists rather than humorists in intention, but read in the light of later days their apparent serious delineations of the frolics and foibles of their time take on a highly humorous aspect. George Pope Morris (1802\u20131864) was one of the founders of The New York Mirror, and for a time its editor. He is best known as the author of the poem, Woodman, Spare That Tree, and other poems and songs. The Little Frenchman and His Water Lots (1839), the first story in the present volume, is selected not because Morris was especially prominent in the field of the short story or humorous prose but because of this single story\u2019s representative character. Edgar Allan Poe (1809\u20131849) follows with The Angel of the Odd (October, 1844, Columbian Magazine), perhaps the best of his humorous stories. The System of Dr. Tarr and Prof. Fether (November, 1845, Graham\u2019s Magazine) may be rated higher, but it is not essentially a humorous story. Rather it is incisive satire, with too biting an undercurrent to pass muster in the company of the genial in literature. Poe\u2019s humorous stories as a whole have tended to belittle rather than increase his fame, many of them verging on the inane. There are some, however, which are at least excellent fooling; few more than that. Probably this is hardly the place for an extended discussion of Poe, since the present volume covers neither American literature as a whole nor the American short story in general, and Poe is not a humorist in his more notable productions. Let it be said that Poe invented or perfected \u2014 more exactly, perfected his own invention of \u2014 the modern short story; that is his general and supreme achievement. He also stands superlative for the quality of three varieties of short stories, those of terror, beauty and ratiocination. In the first class belong A Descent into the Maelstrom (1841), The Pit and the Pendulum (1842), The Black Cat (1843), and The Cask of Amontillado (1846). In the realm of beauty his notable productions are The Assignation (1834), Shadow: a Parable (1835), Ligeia (1838), The Fall of the House of Usher (1839), Eleonora (1841), and The Masque of the Red Death (1842). The tales of ratiocination \u2014 what are now generally termed detective stories \u2014 include The Murders in the Rue Morgue (1841) and its sequel, The Mystery of Marie Rog\u00eat (1842\u20131843), The Gold-Bug (1843), The Oblong Box (1844), \u201cThou Art the Man\u201d (1844), and The Purloined Letter (1844). Then, too, Poe was a master of style, one of the greatest in English prose, possibly the greatest since De Quincey, and quite the most remarkable among American authors. Poe\u2019s influence on the short story form has been tremendous. Although the effects of structure may be astounding in their power or unexpectedness, yet the means by which these effects are brought about are purely mechanical. Any student of fiction can comprehend them, almost any practitioner of fiction with a bent toward form can fairly master them. The merit of any short story production depends on many other elements as well \u2014 the value of the structural element to the production as a whole depends first on the selection of the particular sort of structural scheme best suited to the story in hand, and secondly, on the way in which this is combined with the piece of writing to form a well-balanced whole. Style is more difficult to imitate than structure, but on the other hand the origin of structural influence is more difficult to trace than that of style. So while, in a general way, we feel that Poe\u2019s influence on structure in the short story has been great, it is difficult rather than obvious to trace particular instances. It is felt in the advance of the general level of short story art. There is nothing personal about structure \u2014 there is everything personal about style. Poe\u2019s style is both too much his own and too superlatively good to be successfully imitated \u2014 whom have we had who, even if he were a master of structural effects, could be a second Poe? Looking at the matter in another way, Poe\u2019s style is not his own at all. There is nothing \u201cpersonal\u201d about it in the petty sense of that term. Rather we feel that, in the case of this author, universality has been attained. It was Poe\u2019s good fortune to be himself in style, as often in content, on a plane of universal appeal. But in some general characteristics of his style his work can be, not perhaps imitated, but emulated. Greater vividness, deft impressionism, brevity that strikes instantly to a telling effect \u2014 all these an author may have without imitating any one\u2019s style but rather imitating excellence. Poe\u2019s \u201cimitators\u201d who have amounted to anything have not tried to imitate him but to vie with him. They are striving after perfectionism. Of course the sort of good style in which Poe indulged is not the kind of style \u2014 or the varieties of style \u2014 suited for all purposes, but for the purposes to which it is adapted it may well be called supreme. Then as a poet his work is almost or quite as excellent in a somewhat more restricted range. In verse he is probably the best artist in American letters. Here his sole pursuit was beauty, both of form and thought; he is vivid and apt, intensely lyrical but without much range of thought. He has deep intuitions but no comprehensive grasp of life. His criticism is, on the whole, the least important part of his work. He had a few good and brilliant ideas which came at just the right time to make a stir in the world, and these his logical mind and telling style enabled him to present to the best advantage. As a critic he is neither broad-minded, learned, nor comprehensive. Nor is he, except in the few ideas referred to, deep. He is, however, limitedly original \u2014 perhaps intensely original within his narrow scope. But the excellences and limitations of Poe in any one part of his work were his limitations and excellences in all. As Poe\u2019s best short stories may be mentioned: Metzengerstein (Jan. 14, 1832, Philadelphia Saturday Courier), Ms. Found in a Bottle (October 19, 1833, Baltimore Saturday Visiter), The Assignation (January, 1834, Godey\u2019s Lady\u2019s Book), Berenice (March, 1835, Southern Literary Messenger), Morella (April, 1835, Southern Literary Messenger), The Unparalleled Adventure of One Hans Pfaall (June, 1835, Southern Literary Messenger), King Pest: a Tale Containing an Allegory (September, 1835, Southern Literary Messenger), Shadow: a Parable (September, 1835, Southern Literary Messenger), Ligeia (September, 1838, American Museum), The Fall of the House of Usher (September, 1839, Burton\u2019s Gentleman\u2019s Magazine), William Wilson (1839: Gift for 1840), The Conversation of Eiros and Charmion (December, 1839, Burton\u2019s Gentleman\u2019s Magazine), The Murders in the Rue Morgue (April, 1841, Graham\u2019s Magazine), A Descent into the Maelstrom (May, 1841, Graham\u2019s Magazine), Eleonora (1841: Gift for 1842), The Masque of the Red Death (May, 1842, Graham\u2019s Magazine), The Pit and the Pendulum (1842: Gift for 1843), The Tell-Tale Heart (January, 1843, Pioneer), The Gold-Bug (June 21 and 28, 1843, Dollar Newspaper), The Black Cat (August 19, 1843, United States Saturday Post), The Oblong Box (September, 1844, Godey\u2019s Lady\u2019s Book), The Angel of the Odd (October, 1844, Columbian Magazine), \u201cThou Art the Man\u201d (November, 1844, Godey\u2019s Lady\u2019s Book), The Purloined Letter (1844: Gift for 1845), The Imp of the Perverse (July, 1845, Graham\u2019s Magazine), The System of Dr. Tarr and Prof. Fether (November, 1845, Graham\u2019s Magazine), The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar (December, 1845, American Whig Review), The Cask of Amontillado (November, 1846, Godey\u2019s Lady\u2019s Book), and Lander\u2019s Cottage (June 9, 1849, Flag of Our Union). Poe\u2019s chief collections are: Tales of the Grotesque and Arabesque (1840), Tales (1845), and The Works of the Late Edgar Allan Poe (1850\u201356). These titles have been dropped from recent editions of his works, however, and the stories brought together under the title Tales, or under subdivisions furnished by his editors, such as Tales of Ratiocination, etc. Caroline Matilda Stansbury Kirkland (1801\u20131864) wrote of the frontier life of the Middle West in the mid-nineteenth century. Her principal collection of short stories is Western Clearings (1845), from which The Schoolmaster\u2019s Progress, first published in The Gift for 1845 (out in 1844), is taken. Other stories republished in that collection are The Ball at Thram\u2019s Huddle (April, 1840, Knickerbocker Magazine), Recollections of the Land-Fever (September, 1840, Knickerbocker Magazine), and The Bee-Tree (The Gift for 1842; out in 1841). Her description of the country schoolmaster, \u201ca puppet cut out of shingle and jerked by a string,\u201d and the local color in general of this and other stories give her a leading place among the writers of her period who combined fidelity in delineating frontier life with sufficient fictional interest to make a pleasing whole of permanent value. George William Curtis (1824\u20131892) gained his chief fame as an essayist, and probably became best known from the department which he conducted, from 1853, as The Editor\u2019s Easy Chair for Harper\u2019s Magazine for many years. His volume, Prue and I (1856), contains many fictional elements, and a story from it, Titbottom\u2019s Spectacles, which first appeared in Putnam\u2019s Monthly for December, 1854, is given in this volume because it is a good humorous short story rather than because of its author\u2019s general eminence in this field. Other stories of his worth noting are The Shrouded Portrait (in The Knickerbocker Gallery, 1855) and The Millenial Club (November, 1858, Knickerbocker Magazine). Edward Everett Hale (1822\u20131909) is chiefly known as the author of the short story, The Man Without a Country (December, 1863, Atlantic Monthly), but his venture in the comic vein, My Double; and How He Undid Me (September, 1859, Atlantic Monthly), is equally worthy of appreciation. It was his first published story of importance. Other noteworthy stories of his are: The Brick Moon (October, November and December, 1869, Atlantic Monthly), Life in the Brick Moon (February, 1870, Atlantic Monthly), and Susan\u2019s Escort (May, 1890, Harper\u2019s Magazine). His chief volumes of short stories are: The Man Without a Country, and Other Tales (1868); The Brick Moon, and Other Stories (1873); Crusoe in New York, and Other Tales (1880); and Susan\u2019s Escort, and Others (1897). The stories by Hale which have made his fame all show ability of no mean order; but they are characterized by invention and ingenuity rather than by suffusing imagination. There is not much homogeneity about Hale\u2019s work. Almost any two stories of his read as if they might have been written by different authors. For the time being perhaps this is an advantage \u2014 his stories charm by their novelty and individuality. In the long run, however, this proves rather a handicap. True individuality, in literature as in the other arts, consists not in \u201cbeing different\u201d on different occasions \u2014 in different works \u2014 so much as in being samely different from other writers; in being consistently one\u2019s self, rather than diffusedly various selves. This does not lessen the value of particular stories, of course. It merely injures Hale\u2019s fame as a whole. Perhaps some will chiefly feel not so much that his stories are different among themselves, but that they are not strongly anything \u2014 anybody\u2019s \u2014 in particular, that they lack strong personality. The pathway to fame is strewn with stray exhibitions of talent. Apart from his purely literary productions, Hale was one of the large moral forces of his time, through \u201cuplift\u201d both in speech and the written word. Oliver Wendell Holmes (1809\u20131894), one of the leading wits of American literature, is not at all well known as a short story writer, nor did he write many brief pieces of fiction. His fame rests chiefly on his poems and on the Breakfast-Table books (1858-1860-1872-1890). Old Ironsides, The Last Leaf, The Chambered Nautilus and Homesick in Heaven are secure of places in the anthologies of the future, while his lighter verse has made him one of the leading American writers of \u201cfamiliar verse.\u201d Frederick Locker-Lampson in the preface to the first edition of his Lyra Elegantiarum (1867) declared that Holmes was \u201cperhaps the best living writer of this species of verse.\u201d His trenchant attack on Homeopathy and Its Kindred Delusions (1842) makes us wonder what would have been his attitude toward some of the beliefs of our own day; Christian Science, for example. He might have \u201cexposed\u201d it under some such title as The Religio-Medical Masquerade, or brought the batteries of his humor to bear on it in the manner of Robert Louis Stevenson\u2019s fable, Something In It: \u201cPerhaps there is not much in it, as I supposed; but there is something in it after all. Let me be thankful for that.\u201d In Holmes\u2019 long works of fiction, Elsie Venner (1861), The Guardian Angel (1867) and A Mortal Antipathy (1885), the method is still somewhat that of the essayist. I have found a short piece of fiction by him in the March, 1832, number of The New England Magazine, called The D\u00e9but, signed O.W.H. The Story of Iris in The Professor at the Breakfast Table, which ran in The Atlantic throughout 1859, and A Visit to the Asylum for Aged and Decayed Punsters (January, 1861, Atlantic) are his only other brief fictions of which I am aware. The last named has been given place in the present selection because it is characteristic of a certain type and period of American humor, although its short story qualities are not particularly strong. Samuel Langhorne Clemens (1835\u20131910), who achieved fame as \u201cMark Twain,\u201d is only incidentally a short story writer, although he wrote many short pieces of fiction. His humorous quality, I mean, is so preponderant, that one hardly thinks of the form. Indeed, he is never very strong in fictional construction, and of the modern short story art he evidently knew or cared little. He is a humorist in the large sense, as are Rabelais and Cervantes, although he is also a humorist in various restricted applications of the word that are wholly American. The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County was his first publication of importance, and it saw the light in the Nov. 18, 1865, number of The Saturday Press. It was republished in the collection, The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County, and Other Sketches, in 1867. Others of his best pieces of short fiction are: The Canvasser\u2019s Tale (December, 1876, Atlantic Monthly), The \u00a31,000,000 Bank Note (January, 1893, Century Magazine), The Esquimau Maiden\u2019s Romance (November, 1893, Cosmopolitan), Traveling with a Reformer (December, 1893, Cosmopolitan), The Man That Corrupted Hadleyburg (December, 1899, Harper\u2019s), A Double-Barrelled Detective Story (January and February, 1902, Harper\u2019s) A Dog\u2019s Tale (December, 1903, Harper\u2019s), and Eve\u2019s Diary (December, 1905, Harper\u2019s). Among Twain\u2019s chief collections of short stories are: The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County, and Other Sketches (1867); The Stolen White Elephant (1882), The \u00a31,000,000 Bank Note (1893), and The Man That Corrupted Hadleyburg, and Other Stories and Sketches (1900). Harry Stillwell Edwards (1855\u2013 ), a native of Georgia, together with Sarah Barnwell Elliott (? \u2013 ) and Will N. Harben (1858\u20131919) have continued in the vein of that earlier writer, Augustus Baldwin Longstreet (1790\u20131870), author of Georgia Scenes (1835). Edwards\u2019 best work is to be found in his short stories of black and white life after the manner of Richard Malcolm Johnston. He has written several novels, but he is essentially a writer of human-nature sketches. \u201cHe is humorous and picturesque,\u201d says Fred Lewis Pattee, \u201cand often he is for a moment the master of pathos, but he has added nothing new and nothing commandingly distinctive An exception to this might be made in favor of Elder Brown\u2019s Backslide (August, 1885, Harper\u2019s), a story in which all the elements are so nicely balanced that the result may well be called a masterpiece of objective humor and pathos. Others of his short stories especially worthy of mention are: Two Runaways (July, 1886, Century), Sister Todhunter\u2019s Heart (July, 1887, Century), \u201cDe Valley an\u2019 de Shadder\u201d (January, 1888, Century), An Idyl of \u201cSinkin\u2019 Mount\u2019in\u201d (October, 1888, Century), The Rival Souls (March, 1889, Century), The Woodhaven Goat (March, 1899, Century), and The Shadow (December, 1906, Century). His chief collections are Two Runaways, and Other Stories (1889) and His Defense, and Other Stories (1898). The most notable, however, of the group of short story writers of Georgia life is perhaps Richard Malcolm Johnston (1822\u20131898). He stands between Longstreet and the younger writers of Georgia life. His first book was Georgia Sketches, by an Old Man (1864). The Goose Pond School, a short story, had been written in 1857; it was not published, however, till it appeared in the November and December, 1869, numbers of a Southern magazine, The New Eclectic, over the pseudonym \u201cPhilemon Perch.\u201d His famous Dukesborough Tales (1871\u20131874) was largely a republication of the earlier book. Other noteworthy collections of his are: Mr. Absalom Billingslea and Other Georgia Folk (1888), Mr. Fortner\u2019s Marital Claims, and Other Stories (1892), and Old Times in Middle Georgia (1897). Among individual stories stand out: The Organ-Grinder (July, 1870, New Eclectic), Mr. Neelus Peeler\u2019s Conditions (June, 1879, Scribner\u2019s Monthly), The Brief Embarrassment of Mr. Iverson Blount (September, 1884, Century); The Hotel Experience of Mr. Pink Fluker (June, 1886, Century), republished in the present collection; The Wimpy Adoptions (February, 1887, Century), The Experiments of Miss Sally Cash (September, 1888, Century), and Our Witch (March, 1897, Century). Johnston must be ranked almost with Bret Harte as a pioneer in \u201clocal color\u201d work, although his work had little recognition until his Dukesborough Tales were republished by Harper & Brothers in 1883. Bret Harte (1839\u20131902) is mentioned here owing to the late date of his story included in this volume, Colonel Starbottle for the Plaintiff (March, 1901, Harper\u2019s), although his work as a whole of course belongs to an earlier period of our literature. It is now well-thumbed literary history that The Luck of Roaring Camp (August, 1868, Overland) and The Outcasts of Poker Flat (January, 1869, Overland) brought him a popularity that, in its suddenness and extent, had no precedent in American literature save in the case of Mrs. Stowe and Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin. According to Harte\u2019s own statement, made in the retrospect of later years, he set out deliberately to add a new province to American literature. Although his work has been belittled because he has chosen exceptional and theatric happenings, yet his real strength came from his contact with Western life. Irving and Dickens and other models served only to teach him his art. \u201cFinally,\u201d says Prof. Pattee, \u201cHarte was the parent of the modern form of the short story. It was he who started Kipling and Cable and Thomas Nelson Page. Few indeed have surpassed him in the mechanics of this most difficult of arts. According to his own belief, the form is an American product ... Harte has described the genesis of his own art. It sprang from the Western humor and was developed by the circumstances that surrounded him. Many of his short stories are models. They contain not a superfluous word, they handle a single incident with grapic power, they close without moral or comment. The form came as a natural evolution from his limitations and powers. With him the story must of necessity be brief.... Bret Harte was the artist of impulse, the painter of single burning moments, the flashlight photographer who caught in lurid detail one dramatic episode in the life of a man or a community and left the rest in darkness.\u201d Harte\u2019s humor is mostly \u201cWestern humor\u201d There is not always uproarious merriment, but there is a constant background of humor. I know of no more amusing scene in American literature than that in the courtroom when the Colonel gives his version of the deacon\u2019s method of signaling to the widow in Harte\u2019s story included in the present volume, Colonel Starbottle for the Plaintiff. Here is part of it: True to the instructions she had received from him, her lips part in the musical utterance (the Colonel lowered his voice in a faint falsetto, presumably in fond imitation of his fair client) \u201cKerree!\u201d Instantly the night becomes resonant with the impassioned reply (the Colonel here lifted his voice in stentorian tones), \u201cKerrow!\u201d Again, as he passes, rises the soft \u201cKerree!\u201d; again, as his form is lost in the distance, comes back the deep \u201cKerrow!\u201d While Harte\u2019s stories all have in them a certain element or background of humor, yet perhaps the majority of them are chiefly romantic or dramatic even more than they are humorous. Among the best of his short stories may be mentioned: The Luck of Roaring Camp (August, 1868, Overland), The Outcasts of Poker Flat (January, 1869, Overland), Tennessee\u2019s Partner (October, 1869, Overland), Brown of Calaveras (March, 1870, Overland), Flip: a California Romance (in Flip, and Other Stories, 1882), Left Out on Lone Star Mountain (January, 1884, Longman\u2019s), An Ingenue of the Sierras (July, 1894, McClure\u2019s), The Bell-Ringer of Angel\u2019s (in The Bell-Ringer of Angel\u2019s, and Other Stories, 1894), Chu Chu (in The Bell-Ringer of Angel\u2019s, and Other Stories, 1894), The Man and the Mountain (in The Ancestors of Peter Atherly, and Other Tales, 1897), Salomy Jane\u2019s Kiss (in Stories in Light and Shadow, 1898), The Youngest Miss Piper (February, 1900, Leslie\u2019s Monthly), Colonel Starbottle for the Plaintiff (March, 1901, Harper\u2019s), A Mercury of the Foothills (July, 1901, Cosmopolitan), Lanty Foster\u2019s Mistake (December, 1901, New England), An Ali Baba of the Sierras (January 4, 1902, Saturday Evening Post), and Dick Boyle\u2019s Business Card (in Trent\u2019s Trust, and Other Stories, 1903). Among his notable collections of stories are: The Luck of Roaring Camp, and Other Sketches (1870), Flip, and Other Stories (1882), On the Frontier (1884), Colonel Starbottle\u2019s Client, and Some Other People (1892), A Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Jack Hamlin\u2019s, and Other Stories (1894), The Bell-Ringer of Angel\u2019s, and Other Stories (1894), The Ancestors of Peter Atherly, and Other Tales (1897), Openings in the Old Trail (1902), and Trent\u2019s Trust, and Other Stories (1903). The titles and makeup of several of his collections were changed when they came to be arranged in the complete edition of his works Henry Cuyler Bunner (1855\u20131896) is one of the humorous geniuses of American literature. He is equally at home in clever verse or the brief short story. Prof. Fred Lewis Pattee has summed up his achievement as follows: \u201cAnother [than Stockton] who did much to advance the short story toward the mechanical perfection it had attained to at the close of the century was Henry Cuyler Bunner, editor of Puck and creator of some of the most exquisite vers de soci\u00e9t\u00e9 of the period. The title of one of his collections, Made in France: French Tales Retold with a U.S. Twist (1893), forms an introduction to his fiction. Not that he was an imitator; few have been more original or have put more of their own personality into their work. His genius was Gallic. Like Aldrich, he approached the short story from the fastidious standpoint of the lyric poet. With him, as with Aldrich, art was a matter of exquisite touches, of infinite compression, of almost imperceptible shadings. The lurid splashes and the heavy emphasis of the local colorists offended his sensitive taste: he would work with suggestion, with microscopic focussings, and always with dignity and elegance. He was more American than Henry James, more even than Aldrich. He chose always distinctively American subjects...FROM THE BOOKS.",

        "description": "The Government Inspector, also known as The Inspector General , is a satirical play by the Russophone Ukrainian playwright and novelist Nikolai Gogol. Originally published in 1836, the play was revised for an 1842 edition. Based upon an anecdote allegedly recounted to Gogol by Pushkin, the play is a comedy of errors, satirizing human greed, stupidity, and the extensive political corruption of Imperial Russia. According to D. S. Mirsky, the play \"is not only supreme in character and dialogue in it is one of the few Russian plays constructed with unerring art from beginning to end. The great originality of its plan consisted in the absence of all love interest and of sympathetic characters. The latter feature was deeply resented by Gogol's enemies, and as a satire the play gained immensely from it. There is not a wrong word or intonation from beginning to end, and the comic tension is of a quality that even Gogol did not always have at his beck and call. The dream-like scenes of the play, often mirroring each other, whirl in the endless vertigo of self-deception around the main character, Khlestakov, who personifies irresponsibility, light-mindedness, absence of measure. \"He is full of meaningless movement and meaningless fermentation incarnate, on a foundation of placidly ambitious inferiority\" (D.S. Mirsky). The publication of the play led to a great outcry in the reactionary press. It took the personal intervention of Tsar Nicholas I to have the play staged, with Mikhail Shchepkin taking the role of the Mayor.",

'The Chronicles of Clovis' is a collection of short stories, including 'The Great Weep', 'Tobermory', 'Adrian', and many more. Hector Hugh Munro was born in Akyab, Burma in 1870. He was raised by aunts in North Devon, England, before returning to Burma in his early twenties to join the Colonial Burmese Military Police. Later, Munro returned once more to England, where he embarked on his career as a journalist, becoming well-known for his satirical 'Alice in Westminster' political sketches, which appeared in the Westminster Gazette. Arguably better-remembered by his pen name, 'Saki', Munro is now considered a master of the short story, with tales such as 'The Open Window' regarded as examples of the form at its finest. Hector Hugh Munro (18 December 1870 - 14 November 1916), better known by the pen name Saki, and also frequently as H. H. Munro, was a British writer whose stories satirize Edwardian society and culture.",

The far right political group the British National Front (BNF) are gaining massive popularity and are expected to make huge inroads into British mainstream in the next general election. A secret agency semi-attached to the government cannot allow this to happen. To have a right wing group anywhere near government would make Britain an international laughing stock and the British like being taken seriously. The agency gets to work. Their plan is to arrange to allow some of BNF's lowest and stupidest members to kill an innocent Black youth. It should be as bloody, violent but most importantly be as public as possible. It's not the kind of operation that they like to perform on British home soil but `needs must' and all that. It shouldn't be too difficult and they don't anticipate any problems. They just need to choose a Black youth. Any youth will do. It's not personal, it's just politics. Kob Armah is the Black youth they mistakenly choose. This story is about him. Kob (for short or Benjamin Kobla Nii-Armah for long) doesn't care about British politics. He has enough Londoneze African problems of his own. He survives the attack in one piece. The same cannot be said about two of his attackers. Kob chooses to hide in Ghana to until things cool off...but that's where his enemies follow him. All of them. WHAT DO YOU CALL IT? It's the Crime Comedy story that capers from London to Accra then back to London. It's got a cool inner-city star, beautiful women, urban to tropical locations, regular bad-guys, secret bad-guys, races, car chases, white van chases, knives, guns... and Supermalt.

The work offers detail about the effects of China\u2019s economic reforms on management control in Chinese enterprises and insightful comparisons with Western theory and Western examples. Readers will discover important themes and the evolution of theory in MCS, including discussions of frameworks and the links between management control and economics, management, accounting, cybernetics and system theory. Early chapters explore management control in Chinese enterprises during the period, especially the demands of (guidance, enforcement and external regulation) and the demand for (stakeholders, managers, investors) management control. The work moves on to explore Western management control theory and research, including an examination of the evolution of internal control theory. The author presents detailed perspectives on the elements of management control systems and introduces masterful new ideas and methods through four general control models and ten critical elements in the management control process. A view of management control in various different types of enterprise is presented, from special enterprises and small to medium enterprises to non-profit organizations. The standards for enterprise management control are explored. This work is a valuable practical guide for corporate management teams who wish to develop and execute their own internal control strategies. It will also provide foreign researchers, policy-makers and practitioners with a new perspective on Chinese management control experiences.",

        "description": "Since the 1970s, the practice of financing major private and public sector capital-intensive projects has shifted to an ever-greater reliance on private funding sources, as opposed to direct financing through the issuance of corporate or government bonds. In the 1990s, these financing practices have undergone further changes with the increasing globalization of capital markets, the growth of derivative instruments, and the rapid increase in information technology that enhances cash-management practices. Today's project financing market is increasingly using sophisticated capital market, bank and agency financing mechanisms as well as using derivative instruments for asset and liability management. Thus, financial market innovations are bringing the once separate fields of project financing and international finance more closely together. This is the first book to treat both topics as an interrelated whole, for contemporary project financing cannot be fully understood without a good working knowledge of the international financial markets that have developed the various financing techniques and funding sources being used. The book provides an in-depth description of cross-border project financing as a technique for financing capital-intensive projects, as well as an overview of certain financing and derivative instruments currently available in the global financial markets. The first part of the book provides an overview of certain funding and derivative instruments currently used in the international financial markets, including a general overview of financial innovations that have occurred in recent decades. Topics covered include an introduction to the syndicated Euro-credit market; an overview of various marketable debt securities actively used in the international financial markets; an introduction to depositary receipt as an innovative way of raising cross-border equity capital; an elaboration of the derivative instruments most commonly used in the project financing arena, including interest rate, currency and commodity swaps; and finally an overview of banks' off-balance sheet activities as a critical driving force for the participation of banks in the international financial and derivative markets. The second part of the book provides an in-depth analysis of project financing that concentrates on the financier's perspective. Topics covered include a general overview of the project financing industry; a step-by-step description of a typical cross-border project finance transaction; a description of the main characteristics and advantages of project financing as opposed to more traditional corporate lending practices; an overview of appraisal techniques for assessing project financing; a comprehensive analysis of the different risk management techniques used in project financing for reducing, distributing and hedging risks; and a brief overview of certain limited-resource financing schemes. The book includes a special focus on the various stages of the risk management process for project financing, elaborating on the different stages of risk identification, risk assessment, risk reduction, risk distribution and hedging and insurance. The authors also provide a comprehensive glossary of terms relating to international finance and project financing. This book will fulfill the need for an essential text on project financing as well as a professional reference guide.",

        "description": "\"I would sleep better if I knew that Bernanke, Geithner, Bachus, Sen. Tim Johnson, Obama and Romney all kept dog-eared copies of Kevin Mellyn's Broken Markets on their nightstands. . . . Mellyn's work is a fascinating, important, and eminently good read and should inform the debate on overhauling the U.S. and global financial regulatory systems and sustainable macro fiscal and monetary policy.\" --Eric Grover, in his review of Broken Markets in The American Banker Broken Markets allows the intelligent non-specialist to understand and navigate the ongoing worldwide aftermath of the 2008 financial market meltdown. The key theme of the book is how the leading financial institutions and the political leadership of the U.S. and European Union have failed us and set the stage for continued market turmoil. It explains what this means for investors, borrowers, society in general, and the financial-services industry. Former banker Kevin Mellyn focuses on providing readers with clear and simple explanations of the forces at work and the potential consequences for their future prosperity. As this book makes clear, what\u2019s coming is a world in which high structural unemployment and flat or declining real income is likely\u2014not to mention a diminished retirement financial safety net. The book therefore provides actionable information for protecting wealth and making prudent investment decisions in an economy that is nothing like the one that has sustained us for decades. As a forward-looking narrative about rapidly changing events and volatile markets and politics, Broken Markets will provide no single prediction about the future but rather describe alternative scenarios and provide the reader with signposts to watch out for in deciding which reality is actually unfolding. Unlike most books written by journalists on global finance, the scenarios and signposts described will be largely based on the lessons of financial and political history rather than breaking news. This book: Tells you in plain language how today\u2019s financial system threatens your livelihood and wealth Tells you why and how governments worldwide, with some notable exceptions, are taking actions likely to make things worse instead of better Explains how the leading financial institutions lost their way during the bubble years and how they can find the path back to prosperity and value to society Tells you what life will be like in a \u201cpost-finance\u201d economy and how you can protect your wealth",

Considerable work in the past has focused on family issues or peer relationships, but these systems have typically been considered separately. This volume bridges the gap across these two important socialization contexts and provides insights into the processes that account for the links across the systems -- the ways in which the relationships between these systems shift across development. In addition, the variations in the links between family and peers are illustrated by cross-cultural work, studies of abused children, and research on the impact of maternal depression. In short, the volume provides not only a convenient overview of recent progress but lays out an agenda for future research.",

        "description": "How can the study of families be scientific? What is the difference between postmodern and positivistic approaches? What is the role of models and metaphors in constructing our theoretical knowledge? In Advancing Family Theories, author James M. White addresses such difficult questions that have been longstanding issues within the field of family studies and examines these matters from a social science perspective. Advancing Family Theories explores two contemporary theories of the family-rational choice theory and transition theory. These diametrically different approaches illuminate what differing theories reveal about families. The book also discusses how meta-theories can assist in building and refining theory and offers insight on the understanding versus explanation debate. Advancing Family Theories gives students a precise notion of what a theory is and how theories work in research. The book not only looks at philosophical realms but also examines particular substantive theory to explain and predict family behaviors.",

A supply chain consists of all the entities and activities that enable the production, distribution, and delivery of products and services to consumers. Research in designing and managing supply chains has rapidly expanded during the last decade. In addition, increased and accessible computing power and modeling capabilities have spurred this growth, enabling researchers to simultaneously consider the many interrelated variables and decisions of a supply chain in a single tractable model.",

The internet eliminates the temporal and spatial constraints on the exchange of information. It changes deeply the world of production and of labour. It transforms the exchange relationships between producers and consumers as well as between the suppliers within the supply-chain. The electronic economy is able to generate more accurate con sumer profiles and, therefore, a more powerful and effective marketing di rected to the individual consumer. There is no industry that is not undergoing thorough changes caused by the internet. The volume at hand gives an analysis of the internet revolution. It covers questions reaching form the highly controversial thesis of the end of property rights in the internet caused by the non-rivalry of the \"consumption\" of in formation to questions regarding the repercussions of the internet on our understanding of the human person. Technological changes like the introduction of the electronic economy pose the question of how to handle it and how to manage reasonably its ethi cal problems and dilemmas. The ethical problems and the business ethics of the electronic economy in the fields of production and labour, of consump tion, and in handling trust and the abuse of trust are analysed by the contribu tions from applied ethics and business ethics.",

While data communications was expected to be the \"wave of the future,\" few industry observers foresaw how rapid the change in focus from voice communications towards data would be. Understanding the data communications revolution has become an urgent priority for many in the telecommunications industry. Demand analysis and forecasting are critical tools to understanding these trends for both Internet access and Internet backbone service. Businesses have led residential customers in the demand for data services, but residential demand is currently increasing exponentiall y. Even as business demand for data communications is becoming better understood, residential broadband access demand is still largely unexplored. Cable modems and ADSL appear to be the current residential broadband choices yet demand elasticities and econometric model-based forecasts for these services are not currently available. The responsiveness of customers to price and income changes and customer's perceptions of the tradeoff in product characteristics between cable modems and ADSL is largely unknown. Demand for Internet access is derived from the demand for applications which utilize this access; access is not demanded independent of its usage. Thus it is important to understand Internet applications in order to understand the demand for access.",

        "description": "--Winner \"Cross Genre\" Category 2018 American Fiction Awards-- [Audiobook narrated by Grammy-winning Stefan Rudnicki and award-winning Gabrielle De Cuir.] Part wacky adventure, part political thriller, this unconventional story will keep you guessing. \"One of the most original and creative stories I have read in a very long time.\" --Goodreads reader with over 1,500 ratings! James Wong built a billion-dollar software company with childhood friend Maria Cortez, but a shady investor stole their company. In a video game, James would defeat the villain with a power-up. Maria tells him there aren't power-ups in real life, but James finds the ultimate power-up watching TV in a bar: become president. Making important life decisions in a bar, what could go wrong? Could a non-politician change their name to None of the Above and get elected president? When James and Maria land their own reality TV show, they try to answer that question. They must uncover secrets about their company and themselves, as the world falls apart around them. It will take every ounce of Maria's strength and every crazy idea James can muster to get their company back. Can they survive the chaos of reality TV, the corruption of Washington, and the dark forces aligned against them? Background: When I began writing the book in 2014, I was afraid that many of my ridiculous subplots, like a presidential candidate with his own reality TV show, were too hard to believe. Then Trump ran for president, and the book became more plausible by the day. When events similar to my book began to happen during the 2016 election cycle, it got so weird that I stopped reading the news. When I went back later to research the \"Fact Versus Fiction\" section after the ending, I found even more events similar to the book had happened. What readers are saying: \"prepare for rib-cracking laughter.\" (Online Book Club reader) \"A thriller in every meaning of the word. If you enjoy action books at all, or if you just want some form of fictional closure on the baffling mess that was the 2016 election, I cannot recommend this book highly enough.\" -- Official Review, Online Book Club (4 out of 4 stars rating) \"The story keeps you guessing and in the third act the intrigue and politics give way to a conclusion full of heart-pounding action.\" \"There's a surprise around every corner--be prepared to laugh, cry and for your heart to race.\" \"Thrilling pacing and breakthrough concepts leaves the reader seared in thought.\" \"Amazingly captures the new political landscape that is forming day-by-day. Fans of political thrillers, conspiracy theories, or those looking for a satirical escape from the dreary news that we see every day will certainly enjoy The Internet President: None of the Above\" -- Official Review, Thriller Magazine (5 out of 5 stars rating and a finalist for International Thriller Award)",

Or, it could describe Amanda Bellwood, a grief-stricken college freshman leading an empty and incomplete life. When Amanda's family is killed in a car crash near Chicago, she must reluctantly move in with Jeff Kipling, an attractive young professor who has been designated by her father as her guardian. Although it is determined that the Bellwood\u2019s vehicle was sabotaged and its occupants murdered, this information is being withheld from the young woman\u2026for her own protection. Conflicted and torn, Amanda unwittingly holds the key to the murder mystery\u2026one that will involve her school and its faculty, the police and a nuclear weapons complex. While her guardian is responsible for keeping Amanda alive and unharmed, Jeff is becoming increasingly attracted to his young ward. It is not until the enemy strikes once more with deadly purpose, that the conspiracy is revealed and Amanda's life can become full once more.",

Dick\u2014that unfolds in the near future, in parallel worlds. In his youth, Richard \u201cDodge\u201d Forthrast founded Corporation 9592, a gaming company that made him a multibillionaire. Now in his middle years, Dodge appreciates his comfortable, unencumbered life, managing his myriad business interests, and spending time with his beloved niece Zula and her young daughter, Sophia. One beautiful autumn day, while he undergoes a routine medical procedure, something goes irrevocably wrong. Dodge is pronounced brain dead and put on life support, leaving his stunned family and close friends with difficult decisions. Long ago, when a much younger Dodge drew up his will, he directed that his body be given to a cryonics company now owned by enigmatic tech entrepreneur Elmo Shepherd. Legally bound to follow the directive despite their misgivings, Dodge\u2019s family has his brain scanned and its data structures uploaded and stored in the cloud, until it can eventually be revived. In the coming years, technology allows Dodge\u2019s brain to be turned back on. It is an achievement that is nothing less than the disruption of death itself. An eternal afterlife\u2014the Bitworld\u2014is created, in which humans continue to exist as digital souls. But this brave new immortal world is not the Utopia it might first seem . . . Fall, or Dodge in Hell is pure, unadulterated fun: a grand drama of analog and digital, man and machine, angels and demons, gods and followers, the finite and the eternal. In this exhilarating epic, Neal Stephenson raises profound existential questions and touches on the revolutionary breakthroughs that are transforming our future. Combining the technological, philosophical, and spiritual in one grand myth, he delivers a mind-blowing speculative literary saga for the modern age.",

        "description": "This book is a welcome reassertion of an old tradition of interdisdplinary research. That tradition has tended to atrophy in the last decade, largely because of an enormous expansion of the domain of neoc1assical economics. The expansion has fed on two sdentific developments: first, human capital theory; second, contract theory. Both developments have taken phenomena critical to the operation of the economy but previously understood in terms of categories separate and distinct from those with which economists generally work and sought to apply the same analytical techniques that we use to understand other economic problems. Human capital theory has applied conventional techniques to questions of labor supply. It began this endeavor with the supply of trained labor and then expanded to a general theory of labor supply by broadening the analysis to the allocation of time over the individual's life, the interdependendes of supply decisions within the family, and finally to the formation of the family itself. Similarly, contract theory has moved from a theory that explains the existence of c10sed economic institutions to a theory of their formation and internaioperation. The hallmark of both of these developments is the extension and applica tion of analytical techniques based on purposive maximization under con traints and the interaction of individual decision makers through a com petitive market or its analogue.",

        "description": "This Palgrave Pivot provides an introduction to the economy and business environment of Vietnam, a member of the ASEAN Economic Community whose economy is rapidly growing. The introduction argues that though there may be perceived disadvantages in investing in Vietnam, there are a number of benefits as well, such as the country's openness to trade and foreign direct investment, the increasing ease of doing business there and the dynamism of the economy. The book then provides an overview of Vietnam's economic policy since 1975, covering reunification, attempts at a command economy, and finally renovation under Doi Moi Policy. Further chapters cover the expansion of the private sector, interest in foreign investment, and the peculiarities of marketing and finance in Vietnam. As an edited volume with chapters written by Vietnamese scholars across economics, history, and business, this book is critical reading for researchers studying Vietnam and other Asian economies and for businesses interested in expanding into that market.",

        "description": "1. Research subject and objectives This study focuses on an economic institution, the large industrial holding company, which continues to hold a prominent if not a strategic position in the resource allocation process in many industrialised market economies. Powerful multicompany combines like the famous Japanese zaibatsu and the less familiar but equally powerful European industrial groups rely on the institution of the holding company to tie their intermarket control network together. Two general questions arise from this situation: first, what factors account for the viability and growth within a market setting of those institutions which internalise allocation decisions and, second, what effect do such institutions have on resource allocation? These questions provide the framework in which the proper research subject can be most adequately introduced. Before doing so, it is crucial to point out that the holding company institution, as analyzed in subsequent chapters, should not be confounded with the legal constructs, bearing the same generic name and flourishing in fiscal paradises, whose sole function is to organise tax evasion across national boundaries. The institution, as studied here, is the large holding company through which industrial groups manage multicompany systems. Such multicompany systems, operating an intermarket network by means of holding companies, continue to be more typical for Europe and Japan than for the United States where, for legal reasons, but also because of managerial efficiency, the multicompany system built around the holding company institution was rather short-lived and 1 the giant integrated multiunit enterprise rose to dominance instead.",

GOETHE Since the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), which are analysed in Part 1, are spe cialized agencies linked by special agreements with the United Nations, a few words about the UN and two of the other specialized agencies, the Food and Agriculture Organization and the International Labour Organization, are called for. This is followed by a short account of the Bank for International Settlements, which is also referred to in connection with the IMF and the IBRD. The rest of this introduction is devoted to some non-European attempts at economic integration (which have not yet been very successful) and to the regional development banks. 1. The United Nations (UN) The United Nations comprises 159 countries (September 1986) which have accepted the Charter of the United Nations, which was signed at San Francisco on 26 June 1945 by fifty-one states and came into force on 24 October 1945. The aims of the organization include the maintenance of peace and security, the promotion of better standards of living and the encouragement of economic and social progress for all nations by means of international cooperation. The principal organs of the UN are: The General Assembly The Security Council The Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) The Trusteeship Council The International Court of Justice The Secretariat.",

Non R&D intensive firms continue to be the economic backbone of several developed industrial countries. They form the core of National Innovation Systems and contribute significantly to growth and employment. However, due to their lack of R&D activity, they are easily overlooked in the general innovation debate. This book provides latest empirical findings on the current economic relevance and specific innovation strategies and management of non-R&D intensive firms in Germany. It discusses their future role in a knowledge driven economy as well as possible implications for innovation and technology policy. An outcome of several years of dedicated research conducted at the Fraunhofer Institute for Systems and Innovation Research (ISI), this book will prove of immense value to researchers and policy makers dealing with innovation and knowledge strategy.",

Now it does not generally matter if somebody is forgotten, only you must mind who. Unfortunately, the king forgot without intending to forget; and so the chance fell upon the Princess Makemnoit, which was awkward. For the princess was the king's own sister; and he ought not to have forgotten her. But she had made herself so disagreeable to the old king, their father, that he had forgotten her in making his will; and so it was no wonder that her brother forgot her in writing his invitations. But poor relations don't do anything to keep you in mind of them. Why don't they? The king could not see into the garret she lived in, could he?FROM THE BOOK",

Simultaneously, a certain European Power made a very polite apology to the Icelandic Government for the falling of a rocket-projectile near Reykjavik. In so doing, it advertised publicly that it had long-range guided missiles capable of flights of over two thousand miles. Next day, Bud Gregory bet on a second dirt-track race and won six dollars more. At very nearly the same instant, Izvestia published a bellicose article which practically called for war on the United States\u2014UNO or no UNO\u2014and a middle European nation offered a calculated, uncalled-for insult to its United States ambassador. The day after, Bud Gregory sat in the bar of a motor-tourist camp and drank beer contentedly all day long. Two days later still, on a mountain highway in the Rockies, the driver of a sixteen-wheel Diesel truck came booming to a sharp curve which had a cliff on one side and a four-hundred-foot drop on the other. The truck thundered around that curve\u2014and ran slap into a rattletrap car with a flapping fabric top and an incredible load of children and household goods. Ran slap into it, that is, to the extent that a collision was inevitable. The jalopy was on the wrong side of the road. The truck could not turn out, nor the jalopy turn in, in time. So the truck-driver froze, and saw the rattletrap vehicle swerve out still farther on the wrong side of the road\u2014ride out until only its inner wheels were on the highway and its outer wheels spun merrily over vacancy",

Baking is essentially chemistry in the kitchen, and Dikla removes the mystery of that chemistry with her easy-to-understand breakdown of how baking works: what purpose each ingredient serves in a recipe, how they combine and interact together and most importantly, how to use the correct temperature and ingredients to get incredible results, every time. She pairs this instruction with easy to follow recipes that readers will use to take their baking to the next level. Learn how to use butter to create a perfectly fluffy and tender cake texture with Almond Chocolate Pound Cake, and create the perfect pie and pie crust with a Rustic Savory Galette. Readers will even learn the best temperature to use to tackle notoriously-tricky treats with her Pistachio Orange Blossom Madeleines. With these 50 recipes, you don\u2019t have to be a scientist to understand how to craft the perfect baked good.",

In an attempt to fill this gap, Michelle Shir-Wise examines not only what people do in their free time, but also how they perceive, interpret and experience it, and in what way it relates to notions of happiness, freedom and the ideal self. Time, Freedom and the Self draws on contemporary theoretical debates concerning the relation between discourse, cultural repertoires, subjective meaning and agency, as well as literature around the sociology of leisure, to inform a unique interpretation of free time (\u201cdisciplined freedom\u201d), developed in the light of questionnaires and in-depth interviews with middle-class, middle-aged participants in suburban Israel.",

This violence occurs when powerful institutions seek to manipulate the thoughts of marginalized people\u2014manufacturing their feelings and fostering a sense of inferiority\u2014for the purpose of disciplinary control. Many American institutions strategically orchestrate this psychic violence through tactics of systemic humiliation. This book reveals how certain counter-measures, based in a commitment to human dignity and respect for every person\u2019s inherent moral worth, can combat this violence. Rothbart and other contributors showcase various examples of this tug-of-war in the US, including the politics of race and class in the 2016 presidential campaign, the dehumanizing treatment of people with mental disabilities, and destructive parenting styles that foster cycles of humiliation and emotional pain.",

The positive psychology movement cultivates a sensible approach to optimal human functioning and well?being in various life contexts. Chapters in this volume will illustrate some of the best of the research on the interplay between the self and positive psychology, to show the potential of this research for transforming our societies. SELF \u2013 Driving Positive Psychology and Well?being thus provides a unique insight into self and its fundamental role for well?being. This volume is intended to develop both theoretical and methodological ideas and to present empirical evidence of various phenomenon important for well ?being. The scope of the volume is thus very broad, and provides a framework for the development of the chapter as authors see most appropriate.",

The authors argue that individual variables cannot provide the complete picture, and that they must instead be understood as part of an interconnected and dynamic system of different factors in order to be useful in a language learning context. Written in an accessible style and suitable for final-year undergraduate and Masters-level students, the book includes clear definitions of key terms, discussion questions for classroom use, practical exercises and activities, and examples of real empirical studies that students and teachers can replicate in their own contexts. This textbook will be of interest to students taking TESOL and SLA courses and modules, as well as those on broader Applied Linguistics programmes.",

        "description": "This book adopts an approach based on relational psychoanalysis, developed in the USA in and since the 1990s and guided by the self-psychology championed by Kohut and the Post-Kohutians. How people infected with HIV/AIDS live their lives is a growing concern in China. The book, based on relational psychoanalysis, explores their self-restoration, and more specifically, how adopting an attitude of \u201cdying to live\u201d helps them face tremendous challenges in life. By interviewing selected individuals at a given organization, the author focuses on their life experiences and on corresponding interventional mechanisms. The book\u2019s three most important features are as follows: 1) its application of self-psychology by Heinz Kohut into the context of psychological intervention; 2) a wealth of qualitative data gathered through in-depth interviews; and 3) the author\u2019s self-reflection and analysis. The book offers a valuable guide for graduate students, researchers, and policymakers alike. By interviewing selected individuals at a given organization, the book focuses on the life histories of selected individuals after being diagnosed with AIDS (screening HIV positive) and on corresponding interventional mechanisms. Further, itemploys the self and self-object as key explanatory terms for the necessary psychotherapeutic interventions,and in order to create guidelines that sufficiently reflect the illness and corresponding interventions. Given its scope and focus, the book offers a valuable guide for graduate students, researchers, and policymakers alike.",

The research method chosen is primarily ethnographic in nature. The data collection tools used in the study are interviews, participant observation and the recording of social narratives to develop an account of literacy and reproductive health care practices. By looking at various bodily representations such as experiences of pain, wounding, the open and closed body, and the social symbolism of pregnancy and childbirth, The Author addresses issues of medical technologies and reproductive health discourse. The Author suggests that future health care initiatives need to take cognisance of patient own literacy practices, their existing cultural understanding of their bodies, health and disease.",

It is inspired by the increased awareness in recent years of the way in which structural and psychosocial dimensions of the life course shape interpersonal relations. Interest in this issue has included both the maintenance of long-term relationships that may span many phases of the life course and the development of relationships that are specific to particular phases. The volume is a combination of invited and author initiated papers--all anonymously peer reviewed--that seeks to present a cohesive source of information on the multiform nature and influences of interpersonal relations from a variety of perspectives, theoretical frames, and substantive areas. Contributions reflect: Macro-micro linkages and interpersonal relations, (i.e., age structures, social institutions, and race/ethnicity) Parenting across the life course Parent-adult child relations and transitions Transitions in non-kin relationships Social relationships and well-being",

From a \u2018symbolic interactionist\u2019 perspective, the author develops a framework for the study of relations between teachers and pupils, discussing the basic ways of analysing social interaction, including the concepts of perception and role. He examines the distinctive perspectives of teachers and pupils on their relationships, bringing together into a coherent framework the insights of such writers as John Holt and Carl Rogers, and within this context he explores the notion of \u2018voluntary schooling\u2019. The book also deals with other important aspects of education such as discipline, classroom group dynamics and the relations between headteachers and their staff. The theories put forward by the author are firmly grounded in the daily experience of teachers and pupils in the classroom at the time. The book was expected to be of value to experienced teachers and student teachers alike, as well as to teachers of the social sciences in general.",

The chapters in this volume discuss the foundations of relationship self-change, how and when it occurs, how it influences relationship decisions and behavior, and how it informs and modifies subsequent knowledge structures, all examined over the course of the relationship cycle (i.e., initiation, maintenance, and dissolution). Additionally, this volume identifies novel applications and extensions of the relationship self-change literature, including applications to health and behavior, intergroup relations, and the workplace. Among the topics discussed: Self-disclosure in the acquaintance process Commitment readiness Bolstering attachment security through close relationships Self-concept clarity and self-change The role of social support in promoting self-development Relationship dissolution and self-concept change Intergroup and sociocultural factors of self-expansion Self-concept change at work Measurement of relationship-induced self-concept change Interpersonal Relationships and the Self-Concept serves both as a comprehensive overview of the existing empirical research as well as a roadmap for future research on self-change, including a discussion of emerging theoretical frameworks. It will interest researchers focusing on romantic relationships, self and identity, and the intersection of self and relationships, spanning the disciplines of psychology, sociology, communication, and family studies.",

        "description": "A concentration on communication processes is essential to sorting out fundamental problems in interpersonal relationships. This book provides a general theory of the role of communication in interpersonal relationships that is grounded in the rules perspective and focuses on self-concept and interaction as the generative mechanisms of relationship formation and growth. The authors explore the kind of information that is exchanged in the process of initiating, developing, and maintaining friend and mate relationships. Both types of relationships are explored in numerous cultural settings--including America and American subcultures as well as Korea, Nigeria, Japan, and China. The inclusion of Nigerian culture is particularly significant because the research literature in interpersonal communication is lacking any information from the continent of Africa. Implications are then considered for communication exchange across three categories of interpersonal communication--culture, conflict, and quality.",

        "description": "This volume summarizes and organizes a growing body of research supporting the role of motivation in adaptive and rewarding interpersonal interactions with others. The field of human motivation is rapidly growing but most studies have focused on the effects of motivation on individuals' personal happiness and task engagement. Only recently have theorists and empiricists begun to recognize that dispositional and state motivations impact the ways individuals approach interpersonal interactions. In addition, researchers are now recognizing that the quality of interpersonal interactions influences consequent happiness and task engagement, thus helping to explain previous findings to this end. Similarly social psychology and relationships researchers have focused on the impact of cognitions, emotions, and behaviors on people's relationships. In their work, relationships researchers demonstrate that both contextual characteristics and individual differences influence the quality of interactions. Many of these studies seek to understand which characteristics strengthen the bonds between people, encourage empathy and trust and create a sense of well-being after a close interaction. This work seeks to integrate the field of human motivation and interpersonal relationships. Both fields have seen extensive growth in the past decade and each can contribute to the other. However, no single compiled work is available that targets both fields. This is the case, in part because only now is there enough work to make a strong and compelling case for their integration. In the previous years, research has been conducted to show that motivation is relevant and important for interactions among strangers and in close relationships. In addition developmental mechanisms for these relations are identified and mechanisms by which motivation strengthens people's relationships. Finally recent work has demonstrated the many implications for interpersonal relationships, showing that motivation impacts a range of interpersonal processes from prejudice regulation and objectification of others to empathy and care. This book seeks to summarize and organize all these findings and present them in a way that is relevant to both motivation researchers and social and relationship researchers.",

        "description": "The technological revolution in the social sciences made available a set of research tools and data manipulation techniques that permit the study of complex social processes previously inaccessible or not amenable to our observational powers. One important set of tools took the generic title \"experimental games,\" which were characterized by the interactive protagonists' pursuit of relatively well-defined goals whose achievement is dependent on the behavior of others. James T. Tedeschi, Barry R. Schlenker, and Thomas V. Bonoma, in this work, explicate these highly structured interactions. The grand strategy of scientific inquiry is the development of explanatory systems for natural phenomena. The empirical tactics devised to manipulate, control, observe, and measure events or processes of interest often require as much ingenuity and imagination as theory development itself. Generally the situation is so structured that certain rules govern participant behavior. Within these constraints the social psychological processes of conflict, influence, power, bargaining, and coalition formation can be studied. Concerned with the more formal and technical aspects of games, the authors explain how they are used for purposes of developing and testing scientific theory. The emphasis throughout is on the development and empirical evaluation of a scientific theory of social influence and power in situations where the interests of the interacting parties are in conflict. Experimental games have provided many of the concepts and the preponderance of evidence that have helped to unravel many of the complexities of social behavior. In Conflict, Power, and Games, the authors build a bridge between technical and non-technical approaches in order to shed greater light on interpersonal relations.",

        "description": "2015 Reprint of 1958 Edition. Full facsimile of the original edition. Not reproduced with Optical Recognition Software. \"The Psychology of Interpersonal Relations\" pioneered the modern field of social cognition. A giant of social psychology, Heider had few students, but his book on social perception had many readers, and its impact continues into the 21st Century, having been cited over 13,000 times. In \"The Psychology of Interpersonal Relations,\" Heider argued that social perception follows many of the same rules of physical object perception, and that the organization found in object perception is also found in social perception. Because biases in object perception sometimes lead to errors (e.g., optical illusions), one might expect to find that biases in social perception likewise lead to errors (e.g., underestimating the role social factors and overestimating the effect of personality and attitudes on behavior). Heider also argued that perceptual organization follows the rule of psychological balance. Although tedious to spell out in completeness, the idea is that positive and negative sentiments need to be represented in ways that minimize ambivalence and maximize a simple, straightforward affective representation of the person. He writes \"To conceive of a person as having positive and negative traits requires a more sophisticated view; it requires a differentiation of the representation of the person into subparts that are of unlike value (1958, p. 182).\" But the most influential idea in \"The Psychology of Interpersonal Relations\" is the notion of how people see the causes of behavior, and the explanations they make for it-what Heider called \"attributions.\" Contents: Introduction -- Perceiving the other person -- The other person as perceiver -- The naive analysis of action -- Desire and pleasure -- Environmental effects -- Sentiment -- Ought and value -- Request and command -- Benefit and harm -- Reaction to the lot of the other person -- Conclusion -- Appendix: A notation for representing interpersonal relations.",

The book is divided into four sections. The first section `Learning Objectives and Programme Structures' addresses the theme of the book. It examines how to ensure that the objectives and structures employed are appropriate in the modern environment. The second section `The Structure of the Learning Environment' is a continuation of the first section but focuses on how the learning environment is designed to facilitate the student's learning. The third section `Information Technology in the Learning Environment' contains two articles examining the use of Information Technology as a learning tool. The final section `Evaluating Student Skills' deals with the important issue of developing the student's skills and how they can be evaluated. This volume addresses issues faced by teachers in higher and further education, but also those involved in programmes of study for continuing professional development.",

At the same time, the pressing concern for improving the quality of higher education has led to a definite need for more knowledge about effective instruction and innovation in economics and business education. The book brings together many examples of reform in economics and business education. Special attention is paid to the problem-based learning approach, which over the past ten years, has developed as a very important innovation in higher education. The book contains contributions from a variety of institutions on the necessity of curriculum reform, the choice of instructional methods, assessment and testing, and management of change. It is of interest for teachers in higher education, educational psychologists, and any person interested in educational innovation in economics and business administration.",

Focusing on India, Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Viet Nam, it discusses government and business sector responses to these issues and how Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) systems and institutions are addressing both the renewal of curricula in the context of green growth dynamics, and patterns of training and skills development to meet demands. In addition, the book examines cross-country issues, concerns and prospects regarding education and skills for inclusive growth and green jobs for the four countries. These include critical themes and issues in the selected industry sectors triggering a demand for green jobs in the region; how industry is responding to those demands; areas impeding the transition from traditional to green practices; the importance of skills development; the role of TVET in addressing industry needs; and reasons for the slow response of TVET to green skills.While other studies conducted in Asia \u2013 and internationally - on the same topic have largely relied on secondary sources, this study conducted by the Asian Development Bank and the Education University of Hong Kong (ADB-EdUHK) is unique in that the findings, conclusions and recommendations reported on are based on primary data. As part of the study, TVET providers, business enterprises, policy makers and practitioners were surveyed using questionnaires and face-to-face interviews. In addition, workshops were held in each of the four countries to ascertain the views of key stakeholders in government, nongovernment organisations, members of the international development community, TVET providers and members of the business sector.The book also provides summaries of the case studies undertaken for India, Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Viet Nam.",

        "description": "During the last few years economics and business education have emerged as one of the largest fields of study in higher education. At the same time, the pressing concern for improving the quality of higher education has led to a definite need for more knowledge about effective instruction and innovation in economics and business education. The book brings together many examples of reform in economics and business education. Special attention is paid to the problem-based learning approach, which over the past ten years, has developed as a very important innovation in higher education. The book contains contributions from a variety of institutions on the necessity of curriculum reform, the choice of instructional methods, assessment and testing, and management of change. It is of interest for teachers in higher education, educational psychologists, and any person interested in educational innovation in economics and business administration.",

        "description": "As new technology fuels the rapid growth of research in psychophysiology, it is essential that those new to the field receive a comprehensive introduction. Psychophysiology: Human Behavior and Physiological Response provides students with elementary information regarding the anatomy and physiology of various body systems, recording techniques, integrative reviews of literature, and concepts in the field. Highly accessible, this book fills a gap between edited handbooks that are often difficult for beginners, and journal articles that may also be a challenge to digest. In this new edition, John L. Andreassi incorporates: *a glossary of terms at the end of each chapter to help students learn definitions of novel terms introduced throughout the book; *a new chapter focusing on the proliferation of neuroimaging studies, including positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI); and *content changes in all chapters to cover new areas of research, as well as to update findings in traditional topics of interest. Upper level undergraduate and beginning graduate students in psychophysiology, biological psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and physiological psychology will benefit immensely from this important text, just as professionals new to psychophysiology will find this book exceptionally useful in their work.",

        "description": "To scientists engaged in research on the cellular mechanisms in the mammalian brain, concepts of \"motivation\" seem to be a logical neces sity, even if they are not fashionable. Immersed in the detailed, time consuming research required to deal with mammalian nerve cells, we usually pay scant attention to the more global brain -behavior questions that have arisen from decades of biological and psychological studies. We felt it was time to confront these issues-namely, how far has neuro biological investigation come in uncovering mechanisms by which moti vational signals influence behavior? At Rockefeller University, we have recently held a course on this subject. We restricted our treatment to those motivational systems most tractable to physiological approaches, and invited scientists skilled in both behavioral issues and physiological techniques to participate. This volume results from that course. The deans and administration at Rockefeller University provided much help in planning the course, and the staff of Springer-Verlag assisted in planning the book. Gabriele Zummer helped organize both the course and the processing of book chapters. They all deserve our thanks. December 1981 Donald W.

        "description": "Charles Richet was one of the most remarkable figures in the history of medical science. He is best known for his work on the body's immune reactions to foreign substances for which he won the Nobel Prize in medicine in 1913. Richet was also a poet, playwright, historian, bibliographer, political activist, classical scholar, and pioneer in aircraft design. Brain, Mind, and Medicine is the first major biography of Richet in any language. Wolf brilliantly situates Richet's work in the intellectual currents of Europe during the latter half of the nineteenth and early twentieth century. Richet's early fame rests largely on his discovery of anaphylaxis, a hypersensitive, potentially fatal reaction to the injection of foreign proteins. In linking such hypersensitivity to the body's self-protective capacities, his work contributed to the unraveling of the mystery of immunity conferred by vaccination and inoculation, but most important, he recognized the role of the brain in regulating the immune system. Richet was a contemporary of Wilhelm Wundt and William James. Together with Richet, they considered psychology to be an aspect of physiology governed by biological laws. But while James and Wundt considered consciousness as a process influenced by experience without much reference to neural structures, Richet's focus was on the brain itself as shaped by genetics and experience and serving as the organ of the mind. Brain, Mind, and Medicine illuminates a significant chapter in scientific and cultural history. It should be read by medical scientists, historians, and individual interested in medicine and psychology.",

        "description": "It was our privilege, some twenty years ago, to assemble a group of Canadian and American investigators to examine the status of research in the then newly burgeoning field of psychological stress (Appley & Trumbull, 1967). As noted, in Chapter 1 of the present volume, there has been rapid development of the area since then. The conference on which the current volume is based was designed to do three things: 1. to further update the field, 2. to bring European and other perspectives to the subject, and 3. to focus on the status of theory of stress. We believe the reader will agree that all three objectives were accom plished, though in so vast and active a field, one can never be totally satisfied. The authors included in this volume are among the leading inves tigators in the field. They represent active research centers and programs in Austria, East and West Germany, Great Britain, Israel, Sweden, and the United States. Their chapters make contributions to stress theory and methodology, inform us meaningfully of the perspectives of the various research programs they represent, and provide, collectively, a description of the dynamics of the stress process as currently emerging.",

        "description": "Excerpt from The History of the Psychoanalytic Movement If in what follows I bring any contribution to the history of the psychoanalytic movement nobody must be surprised at the subjective nature of this paper, nor at the role which falls to me therein. For psychoanalysis is my creation; for ten years I was the only one occupied with it, and all the annoyance which this new subject caused among my contemporaries has been hurled upon my head in the form of criticism. Even today, when I am no longer the only psychoanalyst, I feel myself justified in assuming that none can know better than myself what psychoanalysis is, wherein it differs from other methods of investigating the psychic life, what its name should cover, or what might better be designated as some thing else. In the year 1909, when I was first privileged to speak publicly on psychoanalysis in an American University, fired by this momentous occasion for my endeavors, I declared that it was not myself who brought psychoanalysis into existence. I said that it was Josef Breuer, who had merited this honor at a time when I was a student and busy working for my examinations (188O-1882). Since then, well-intentioned friends have frequently repeated that I then expressed my gratitude out of all due proportion. They considered that, as on previous occasions, I should have dignified Breuer's \"cathartic procedure\" as merely preliminary to psycho analysis, and should have claimed that psychoanalysis itself only began with my rejection of the hypnotic technique and my introduction of free association.

        "description": "This is a fascinating history of how psychoanalysis became an essential element of contemporary Argentine culture--in the media, in politics, and in daily private lives. The book reveals the unique conditions and complex historical process that made possible the diffusion, acceptance, and popularization of psychoanalysis in Argentina, which has the highest number of psychoanalysts per capita in the world. It shows why the intellectual trajectory of the psychoanalytic movement was different in Argentina than in either the United States or Europe and how Argentine culture both fostered and was shaped by its influence. The book starts with a description of the Argentine medical and intellectual establishments\u0092 reception of psychoanalysis, and the subsequent founding of the Argentine Psychoanalytic Association in 1942. It then broadens to describe the emergence of a \"psy culture\u0094 in the 1960s, tracing its origins to a complex combination of social, economic, political, and cultural factors. The author then analyzes the role of \"diffusers\u0094 of psychoanalysis in Argentina--both those who were part of the psychoanalytic establishment and those who were not. The book goes on to discuss specific areas of reception and diffusion of psychoanalytic thought: its acceptance by progressive sectors of the psychiatric profession; the impact of the psychoanalytically oriented program in psychology at the University of Buenos Aires; and the incorporation of psychoanalysis into the theoretical artillery of the influential left of the 1960s and 1970s. Finally, the author analyzes the effects of the military dictatorship, established in 1976, on the \"psy\u0094 universe, showing how it was possible to practice psychoanalysis in a highly authoritarian political context.",

        "description": "Psychoanalytic Method in Motion identifies and examines varied controversies about how psychoanalysts believe treatment should best be conducted. Irrespective of their particular school of thought, every analyst builds up a repertoire of his favored ways of working, which some analysts come to see as the most efficacious approach to treatment available. While such differences of opinion are unsettling, and may even threaten to tear the field asunder, this book sees these differences as benefitting psychoanalysis by improving the ways in which psychoanalysts and psychoanalytic psychotherapists practice. In this book, Richard Tuch covers the waterfront by examining controversies that further the field by raising questions that help evolve the treatment, challenging every analyst to re-think what they are doing in the consulting room...and why. Some of the chief controversies explored include: the enactment debate\u2014unparalleled tool or regrettable error? whether analysts can truly be \"objective\"\u2014whatever that means the advantages and disadvantages arising from the analyst\u2019s use of authority the ways in which theory influences the analyst\u2019s search for data\u2014blinding him to evidence he implicitly discards as irrelevant whether any given treatment approach is more efficacious than others, as some analysts claim the legitimacy of psychoanalysis itself\u2014whether it can truly be considered scientific whether certain methods of supervision are more effective than others whether free association can be considered therapeutic in and of itself the extent to which an analyst preferred clinical theory is a product of his personality Drawing on ideas from a range of different analytic perspectives, this book is an essential and accessibly written guide to working towards best practice in the analytic setting. Psychoanalytic Method in Motion will appeal greatly to both students and practitioners of psychoanalysis and psychoanalytic psychotherapy.",

        "description": "For several decades the writings of sociologist Neil J. Smelser have won him a vast and admiring audience across several disciplines. Best known for his work on social movements, economic sociology, and British social history, Smelser's psychoanalytic writings are less familiar to his readers. In fact, many people are completely unaware of Smelser's formal psychoanalytic training and ongoing counseling practice. With the publication of The Social Edges of Psychoanalysis, Smelser's thought-provoking essays on psychoanalytic concepts are finally brought together in one book. Psychoanalytic theory has had an ambivalent relationship with sociology, and these essays explore that ambivalence, providing arguments about how and why psychoanalytic approaches can deepen the sociological perspective. One of Smelser's main tenets is that human social behavior always contains both social-structural and social-psychological elements, and that psychoanalytic theory can bridge these two dimensions of human social life. Many of the issues Smelser addresses\u2014including interdisciplinarity, the macro-micro link in research, masculinity and violence, and affirmative action\u2014have generated considerable scholarly interest. This collection paves the way for further articulation of the relationship between sociology and psychoanalysis at a time when many sociologists are looking for interdisciplinary links in their work. Presented with clarity and grace, and free of the murkiness often found in both sociological and psychoanalytic writing, Smelser's new book will excite reflection and research on the less visible dynamics of social existence.",

        "description": "Movement, Velocity, and Rhythm from a Psychoanalytic Perspective: Variable Speed(s) explores philosophical and psychoanalytic theories, as well as artworks, that show sensible bodily rituals for reviving our social and subjective lives. With a wide range of contributors from interdisciplinary backgrounds, it informs readers on how to find rituals for syncing ourselves with others and world rhythms. The book is divided into three parts on variability, speed, and slowness, and explores rhythmic rituals of renewal, revolution, and reflection. Each chapter provides unique examples from the applied arts, film, television, and literature to show how different practices of rhythm might aid in creative and deep contemplation and includes philosophical and cultural theories for bodily and rhythmic renewal. Without being limited to a clinical perspective, this book provides wide-ranging discussions of the relation between rhythm, trauma, cultural studies, psychosocial studies, continental philosophy, critical psychology, Lacan, and film, to explore modes of becoming more attuned to each moment, to others, and to our own era. Movement, Velocity, and Rhythm from a Psychoanalytic Perspective will be essential reading for Lacanian psychoanalysts in practice and in training, as well as anyone interested in rhythm at the intersection of Lacanian psychoanalysis and continental philosophy.",

        "description": "In the early 1970s, the preeminence of psychoanalysis in the treatment of mental illness gave way to a number of other approaches. Yet, rather than practicing in cooperation, the different schools--existentialism, psychoanalysis, interpersonalism, behaviorism--each taught its own methods, convinced it was the true psychiatry. As a result, all too frequently, varieties of psychiatry have come and gone, wallowing in a battle of sects rather than progressing toward knowledge. In Psychiatric Movements, Leston Havens posits that psychiatry must adopt a pluralistic stance, for only an inclusive psychiatry can bridge the traditional scientific quest of medicine with a humanistic interest in whole lives, inner states, and relationships with others. If for no other reason, from an ethical standpoint, the patient should get the treatment he needs, not the one treatment the doctor dispenses. This edition includes a new introduction explaining changes in the field during the last thirty years. \"This is an excellent book, profound, scholarly, thoughtful, and thought provoking.\"--Chase P. Kimball, Contemporary Psychology \"This book is an intellectual delight, and should be a must' for psychiatry residents.\"--Israel Zwerling, International Journal of Group Psychotherapy \"Students of clinical psychiatry...and practitioners will profit immensely from this book... Teachers of psychiatry should read it to enrich their understanding of what they teach and how it relates to the broader world of psychiatry.\"--Robert Michels, Journal of Nervous and Mental Diseases \"[This] is one of the most eloquent monographs of which I am aware concerning pluralism in modern American psychiatry.\"--Michael H. Ebert, Psychiatry Resident Leston Havens is professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, Cambridge Hospital. He is the author of several books, including A Safe Place: Laying the Groundwork of Psychotherapy and Making Contact: Uses of Language in Psychotherapy. S. Nassir Ghaemi is assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director of the Bipolar Disorder Research Program at Cambridge Hospital. He is the author or editor of several books, including Mood Disorders and The Concepts of Psychiatry.",

        "description": "1. 1. Motivation This book is based on the view-tx)int that both public and private decision making, in practice, can often be ilrproved upon by means of fonnal (nonnative) decision nodels and methods. To sane extent, the validity of this statement can be measured by the irrpressive number of su=esses of disciplines as operations research and management science. Hcwever, as witnessed by the many discussions in the professional journals in these fields, many rrodels and methods do not completely meet the requirements of decision making in prac\u00ad tice. Of all possible origins of these clear shortcomings, we main-\u00b7 ly focus on only one: the fact that nost of these nodels and methods are unsuitable for decision situations in which multiple and possi\u00ad bly conflicting objectives playa role, because they are concentra\u00ad ted on the (optimal) fulfilment of only one objective. The need to account for multiple goals was observed relatively early. Hoffman [1955], while describing 'what seem to be the prin\u00ad cipal areas (in linear prograrrrning) where new ideas and new methods are needed' gives an exanple with conflicting goals. In this pro\u00ad blem, the assignrrent of relative weights is a great problem for the planning staff and is 'probably not the province of the mathemati\u00ad cian engaged in solving this problem'. These remarks were true pre\u00ad cursors of later develor:nents. Nevertheless, the need for methods dealing with multiple goals was not widely recognized until much later.",

        "description": "What Lemonade Stand Economics will do... Give students a plan to pay for college without needing student loans. Sitting in the financial aid office at freshman orientation is not the time to start planning how you are going to pay for college. The best way to avoid student loan debt is to never sign the loan papers in the first place. In order to do that you need a plan. Lemonade Stand Economics is that plan. Educate students in financial literacy. Financial literacy standards are written right into Lemonade Stand Economics making it useful in the classroom. High schools introduce students to the basics of money management, but Lemonade Stand Economics takes it to another level by teaching students the importance of planning for their financial future, budgeting, setting financial goals and how debt impacts them after graduation. Teach students skills that will benefit them for the rest of their lives regardless of where their career path takes them. Even more important than the money students make working for themselves, is the real world education they receive. Time management, money management, how to market yourself, workplace etiquette, overcoming fear and handling rejection along with the importance of budgeting and the pain of debt. Real issues that are better learned during high school then after college. Paying for college is easier than you think Lemonade Stand Economics teaches high school students how to work for themselves and graduate from college without student loans. Learn to make $15, $20 or even $50 per hour working for yourself and pay for college one semester at a time. It's not hard if you know what to do, but that's the problem. As a high school student you just don't know where to start. Lemonade Stand Economics shows you what you do... and where to start. There is a problem in America - some say an epidemic - called student loan debt. High school students want to attend college but most don't have the money set aside to pay for it. Most take out student loans for four years, graduate, and start off their adult life in debt. Often times starting their adult lives with massive debt. These students are not stupid or lazy, in fact they are quite smart and energetic, but they don't know where to start or what to do to earn enough money to pay for college. They don't need that job slapping sandwiches together for minimum wage and going home smelling like bologna and pickles. That's not going to pay for college! The typical college student graduates with $26,000 in student loans. The typical college graduate takes over 17 years to pay off their student loans. You don't have to be typical! With a good plan you can pay for college without student loans or money from your parents. Lemonade Stand Economics will teach you how to set goals, budget, advertise, market, price jobs, and serve up a steamin' hot plate of fantastic customer service. Once in this money making rhythm you will make enough to pay for college and graduate with no debt. Let your little brother run the lemonade stand now, it's time to make some real money.",

Disappointingly, functional departmental silos within universities still exist and keep problem solvers from seeing all the effects of a given issue. In addition to providing teaching material, Decision Making in Marketing and Finance provides motives and strategies to break down functional silos in making informed and effective business and finance decisions. Koku achieves his goal by showing how value can be created for shareholders and other stakeholders, linking marketing and finance decision making, and providing much-needed teaching materials for an interdisciplinary approach to case analysis.",

High inflation and fluctuating exchange rates in the de veloped Western world have served to strengthen the forces of disequilibrium in the fmancial markets, leading to an investment situation with several unusual but significant factors. Capital spending by business, leading to the creation of new jobs, has not been reduced substantially during this period of uncertainty, as happened in similar periods in the past. This is shown in part by the continuing low unemployment rates in evidence during the period, which are in contradic tion to the trend exhibited in similar past periods. The expanding financing re quirements resulting from high price inflation have led to an increase in the capital intensity of firms, and thus to enhanced sensitivity of their income streams to economic fluctuations. At the same time, the record high interest rates that companies have had to pay to acquire this inflated amount of capital have caused a deterioration in the safety or quality indica tors by which the creditworthiness of the firms is judged. These developments tend to increase vii viii INTRODUCTION the stakes involved in business decision making. One important repercussion of this is that greater attention is now being focused on improving the quality of investment decisions.",

First, the accounting system is profitably thought of as a library of financial statistics. Answers to a variety of questions are unlikely to be found in prefabricated fonnat, but valuable infonnation awaits those equipped to in the accounting library is most interrogate the library. Second, the infonnation unlikely to be the only infonnation at the manger's disposal. So knowing how to combine accounting and nonaccounting bits of infonnation is an important, indeed indispensable, managerial skill. Finally, the role of a professional manager is emphasized. This is an individual with skill, talent, and imagination, an individual who brings professional quality skills to the ta sk of managing. This book also makes demands on the reader. It assumes the reader has had prior exposure to financial accounting, economics, statistics, and the economics of uncertainty (in the fonn of risk aversion and decision trees). A modest acquaintance with strategic, or equilibrium, modeling is also presumed, as is patience with abstract notation. The hook does not make deep mathematical demands on the reader. An acquaintance with linearprogramming and the ability to take a simple derivative are presumed. The major prerequisite is a tolerance for (if not a predisposition toward) abstract notation. This st yle and list of prerequisites are not matters of taste or author imposition.",

All our previous assumptions about God, our social, economic and political structures, science and technology, and - by extension - ourselves and our culture have been utterly transformed. The 20th century is the century that dared to question everything and its progress is told in this tour de force. Modern Times are explored through the cultural expressions - in art, in literature, in music - of the true conviction that we have lived through an unprecedentedly testing period in human experience. Modern Places are the locations that became the frontiers of modernity - cities like Vienna, Moscow, Paris and Berlin, new worlds in the Americas, and a preview of a possible future in Moscow.",

        "description": "The Twentieth-Century World, 1914 to the Present introduces students to five distinct historical themes in 20th century history - politics, economics, religion, technology and the environment. Each of these themes is set in a social and cultural history framework that emphasizes the commonalities and diversity in human experiences throughout the recent era. This is a genuinely global textbook that takes a non-nationalistic approach to history and attempts to avoid marginalising the role of non-western actors and societies. John Corbally explores the connections, interactions and exploitations of global resources and peoples that were part and parcel of 20th-century history. Economically, the book shows how people were connected by the spread of global capitalism and communism. It explores the spread of traditional religions and philosophies all over the globe, as well as looking at secular challenges. It also considers how technology reached further into people's lives. Ideal for undergraduate level students of 20th-century history, this is a book that offers a balanced, multi-perspective approach to recent global history, helping the 21st-century student understand today's world and interrogate commonly held assumptions about its history.",

        "description": "Winner, 2010 Emily Toth Award for Best Book in Women\u2019s Studies, Popular Culture Association/American Culture Association The Modern Period examines how and why Americans adopted radically new methods of managing and thinking about menstruation during the twentieth century. In the early twentieth century women typically used homemade cloth \"diapers\" to absorb menstrual blood, avoided chills during their periods to protect their health, and counted themselves lucky if they knew something about menstruation before menarche. New expectations at school, at play, and in the workplace, however, made these menstrual traditions problematic, and middle-class women quickly sought new information and products that would make their monthly periods less disruptive to everyday life. Lara Freidenfelds traces this cultural shift, showing how Americans reframed their thinking about menstruation. She explains how women and men collaborated with sex educators, menstrual product manufacturers, advertisers, physical education teachers, and doctors to create a modern understanding of menstruation. Excerpts from seventy-five interviews\u2014accounts by turns funny and moving\u2014help readers to identify with the experiences of the ordinary people who engineered these changes. The Modern Period ties historical changes in menstrual practices to a much broader argument about American popular modernity in the twentieth century. Freidenfelds explores what it meant to be modern and middle class and how those ideals were reflected in the menstrual practices and beliefs of the time. This accessible study sheds new light on the history of popular modernity, the rise of the middle class, and the relationship of these phenomena to how Americans have cared for and managed their bodies.",

        "description": "In the early decades of the twentieth century, engagement with science was commonly used as an emblem of modernity. This phenomenon is now attracting increasing attention in different historical specialties. Being Modern builds on this recent scholarly interest to explore engagement with science across culture from the end of the nineteenth century to approximately 1940. Addressing the breadth of cultural forms in Britain and the western world from the architecture of Le Corbusier to working class British science fiction, Being Modern paints a rich picture. Seventeen distinguished contributors from a range of fields including the cultural study of science and technology, art and architecture, English culture and literature examine the issues involved. The book will be a valuable resource for students, and a spur to scholars to further examination of culture as an interconnected web of which science is a critical part, and to supersede such tired formulations as 'Science and culture'.",

The material culture of diplomacy includes all practices in foreign policy communication in which single artifacts, samples of artifacts, or else the whole material setting of diplomatic interaction is supposed to be constitutive for creating an intended effect in terms of diplomatic objectives. The chapters of this volume focus on intercultural diplomacy in different regions of the world wherein diplomatic actors of various kinds might have been confronted by a whole universe of unfamiliar artifacts and artifact-related practices. Most of them concentrate on gift giving as a diplomatic practice that offers multiple insights in the complex dynamics of diplomatic relations between representatives of culturally highly diverse political entities. In doing so, they gainfully apply different theoretical approaches of material culture as an interdisciplinary field of study to the investigation of diplomatic cultures across the globe. As a result, it becomes obvious that future research into the history of diplomacy should take into account material practices much more thoroughly than has been done before.",

        "description": "Participation in sports is a major feature of daily living for children and adolescents in many countries of the world. Structures of organized programs vary within and among countries. Likewise, sport offerings and values attached to these sports vary with cultural context. Sport is also a primary source of physical activity for many children and adolescents, and is an arena in which personal and inter-personal values and behaviors are developed and nurtured. Key players in these important functions of sport are peers, coaches and parents. The volume is aimed primarily for students of Physical Education and Sport Sciences, coaches, trainers, parents and others involved in youth sport programs and in the preparation of young athletes . The content s have application to a variety of cultural contexts given the near universality of sport for youth throughout the world. The editors hope that the contributions which comprise this volume will serve to enhance the sport experiences of youth, minimize potential risks , and maximize potential benefits by educating adults who work with them in the context of sport. Robert M Malina This book addresses relevant issues within the scope of organized sports. Chapters are written by distinguished contributors with a comprehensive list of topics that under the coordination, the leadership and expertise of the editors, provided the scientific literature with an unique and in depth analysis of social, biological, cultural and related interactions. This book is published by the renowned University of Coimbra. The same University that only a short time ago began to offer a course in Physical Education and Sport under the intellectual and scientific leadership of Francisco Sobral Leal. His work in Portugal is both unique and pioneering. Here he has been able to be influential. This book, due to its quality and the nature of its topics, is thus a fine tribute to his work and culture of interaction. A tribute of science in the name of knowledge. Luis Bettencourt Sardinha",

        "description": "The Winter's Tale is a play by William Shakespeare, originally published in the First Folio of 1623. Although it was grouped among the comedies, some modern editors have relabelled the play as one of Shakespeare's late romances. Some critics consider it to be one of Shakespeare's \"problem plays\", because the first three acts are filled with intense psychological drama, while the last two acts are comedic and supply a happy ending. The play has been intermittently popular, revived in productions in various forms and adaptations by some of the leading theatre practitioners in Shakespearean performance history, beginning after a long interval with David Garrick in his adaptation Florizel and Perdita (first performed in 1754 and published in 1756). The Winter's Tale was revived again in the 19th century, when the fourth \"pastoral\" act was widely popular. In the second half of the 20th century The Winter's Tale in its entirety, and drawn largely from the First Folio text, was often performed, with varying degrees of success.",

This tightly constructed work revolves around four central characters: Othello, a Moorish general in the Venetian army; his beloved wife, Desdemona; his loyal lieutenant, Cassio; and his trusted but unfaithful ensign, Iago. Because of its varied and current themes of racism, love, jealousy, betrayal, revenge and repentance, Othello is still often performed in professional and community theatre alike and has been the basis for numerous operatic, film, and literary adaptations.",

        "description": "Troilus and Cressida is a tragedy by William Shakespeare, believed to have been written in 1602. It was described by Frederick S. Boas as one of Shakespeare's problem plays. The play ends on a very bleak note with the death of the noble Trojan Hector and destruction of the love between Troilus and Cressida. Throughout the play, the tone lurches wildly between bawdy comedy and tragic gloom, and readers and theatre-goers have frequently found it difficult to understand how one is meant to respond to the characters. However, several characteristic elements of the play (the most notable being its constant questioning of intrinsic values such as hierarchy, honour and love) have often been viewed as distinctly \"modern,\" as in the following remarks on the play by author and literary scholar Joyce Carol Oates: Troilus and Cressida, that most vexing and ambiguous of Shakespeare's plays, strikes the modern reader as a contemporary document\u2014its investigation of numerous infidelities, its criticism of tragic pretensions, above all, its implicit debate between what is essential in human life and what is only existential are themes of the twentieth century. ... This is tragedy of a special sort\u2014the \"tragedy\" the basis of which is the impossibility of conventional tragedy",

        "description": "The merchant Egeon is caught crossing the border from Syracuse into the rival city of Ephesus\u2014a crime punishable by death. But Egeon isn't a criminal; he's merely trying to find his wife and one of his twin sons, who were separated from him after a shipwreck twenty-five years ago. The Duke takes pity on Egeon after hearing his story and grants him a day to raise the money necessary to save his life. What Egeon isn't aware of is that both of his twin sons are now in Ephesus, and with two identical sons in one city, strange mix-ups are bound to happen. A tale of mistaken identities, this unabridged version of one of English playwright William Shakespeare's earliest comedic plays was first performed in 1594 and published in Shakespeare's First Folio in 1623.",

        "description": "Over the past fifteen years, Jonathan Goldberg's wide-ranging essays have been among the most sophisticated, influential, and controversial writing about Shakespeare. He challenges the critical orthodoxy, provoking scholars to reassess both their own assumptions and those underpinning the field of Shakespeare studies. Collected in one volume for the first time, these essays offer a sustained, energetic, and rigorous examination of issues of gender and sexuality that pervade Shakespeare's plays, as well as a road map of the shifts during the past two decades in our understanding of English literature's most canonical figure. Central to these essays are concerns about textuality as considered from a number of vantage points, including deconstructionist, psychoanalytic, and historicist. Goldberg studies most of Shakespeare's plays, giving particular emphasis to Henry IV, Parts 1 and 2, and to Romeo and Juliet; he focuses throughout on the relationship between the text as material object and the reality created or reflected by that text. Among the issues he considers are the textual instability of Shakespeare's plays and the historical instabilities of gender and sexuality depicted in those plays, the construction of gender and the dehumanization implicit in treating characters as a textual production, the function of letters and other documents within the Shakespearean texts, and the correlation of sexual politics and textual desire. Tracing a path from characters in the scriptive sense to their embodiment in characters marked by gender and sexuality, Shakespeare's Hand provides a brilliant set of inquiries into the production, critical reception, and conditions of Shakespearean texts.",

Those plans lead them to the burnt-out remains of an old building complex where the past doesn\u2019t lie peacefully below the surface. Jane somehow feels drawn to the strange place with its air of dark mystery and is compelled to touch the ruins. The next thing they know the charred remains vanish and they stand in the middle of a pristine garden. They\u2019re also surrounded by fox shifters bearing weapons and old-fashioned garb.

The past has already been written, but might they rewrite those events? And if they change the past, what will happen to their future? Will they remain trapped in the past forever, or worse, cease to exist at all?

Despite being held captive by the Mage Lords, Ember and Cori refuse to give up on their plans to find the other dragon shifters. But if the hunters get there first, it'll be an all-out bloodbath. Ember and her friends race the clock to find out the truth lost with their memories, but between the League's threat, a too-tempting ex-hunter, and the plight of her people, Ember must pick a side.

I made a promise to a faerie, and they\u2019ve come to deliver. A powerful talisman has disappeared, and without it, the faeries in this realm are losing their magic.

The goal is to allow anyone to do magic, not just the sorcerer elite. The outcome of his quest is unlike anything he could\u2019ve ever imagined \u2013 because, instead of an object, he creates Her. She is Gala, and she is anything but inanimate. Born in the Spell Realm, she is beautiful and highly intelligent \u2013 and nobody knows what she\u2019s capable of. She will do anything to experience the world . . . even leave the man she is beginning to fall for. Augusta, a powerful sorceress and Blaise\u2019s former fianc\u00e9e, sees Blaise\u2019s deed as the ultimate hubris and Gala as an abomination that must be destroyed. In her quest to save the human race, Augusta will forge new alliances, becoming tangled in a web of intrigue that stretches further than any of them suspect. She may even have to turn to her new lover Barson, a ruthless warrior who might have an agenda of his own . . .",

Theorizing finance and taxation in relation to a national political system, the authors explain the current tangled-up realities of China's creaky, inherited and uneven tax system- and put forward a plan for radical change. This book will be of interest to finance professionals, economists, and scholars of the Chinese economy. The focus is to properly handle the three basic economic and social relations between the government and the market (and the enterprises as the main market entities), between the central and local governments, and between the public power system and the citizens. This book follows the research context of problem orientation \u2013 goal orientation - practical operation, and puts forward the ideas, basic goals and paths of fiscal system reform that adapt to the modernization of national governance.",

        "description": "This monograph highlights the benefits of public-private partnerships (PPP) for Sub-Saharan Africa. By studying the intertwinement of mainstream and Islamic finance, the author shows how PPPs have emerged as a viable and efficient organizational vehicle for fair rules of economic cooperation where the trade-offs between profit maximization and social justice values required by Islamic finance occur within the organization. The book shows the assumptions under which such compromise is beneficial to all parties, including public entities, multicultural societies and private Islamic and conventional investors. It places particular emphasis on changing the principle of allocating public resources in the uncertain legal and economic environment of the region discussed. Given the cultural idiosyncrasies, political instability, and socio-economic turmoil but high development potential in Sub-Saharan Africa, PPPs with a heterodox approach may prove to be a game-changer in the region and a platform to find a compromise between the interests of various types of investors.",

The research related component highlights novel methods and software for economic reasoning under uncertainty and for fusion of qualitative/quantitative model-based economic reasoning.",

        "description": "Business modelling is a vast arena of research and practice, which is gaining increasing important in the rapid development of e-commerce, globalization, and in particular, the movement toward global e-business. The ability to utilize advanced computing technology to model, analyse and simulate various aspects of ever-changing businesses has made a significant impact on the way businesses are designed and run these days. With the current global e-business and e-commerce initiatives, it has become important that all businesses carefully validate their business objectives, requirements, and strategies through a careful process of formal business modelling. It is important for effective enterprise decision making to have clear, concise business models that allow the extraction of critical value from business processes and specify the rules to be globally enforced. Particularly in e-business specifications, the need to be unambiguous, accurate, and complete becomes even greater, because there may be no human mediator or agent to rely on in complex or unforeseen situations. Business Modelling: Multidisciplinary Approaches - Economics, Operational, and Information Systems Perspectives, arranged in three parts, brings scholarly perspectives from various disciplines to bear on some of the critical aspects of business modeling. The first part (chapters 1-8) focuses on business modelling fundamentals and starts with a series of economics and operations research perspectives. The second part (chapters 9-19) concentrates on modelling in electronic businesses and focuses on Management Information Systems and Decision Support Systems. The third part (chapters 20-22) centers on multidisciplinary business modelling progress, in particular on the seminal work of Professor Andrew B. Whinston.",

        "description": "Information and knowledge have fundamentally transformed the way businesses and social institutions work. Knowledge management promises concepts and instruments that help organizations to create an environment supportive of knowledge creation, sharing and application. Information and communication technologies (ICT) are often regarded as the enabler for knowledge management initiatives. The book presents an almost encyclopedic treatise of the facets, concepts and theories that have influenced knowledge management and the state of practice concerning strategy, organization, systems and economics. The second edition updates the material to cover the most recent developments in ICT-supported knowledge management. The book particularly provides a more in-depth coverage of its theoretical foundation including a new account of knowledge work, discusses the potentials and challenges of process-oriented knowledge management, adds a new chapter on modelling that plays an important role in knowledge management initiatives and contrasts architectures for centralized and distributed or peer-to-peer knowledge management systems.",

        "description": "Security has been a human concern since the dawn of time. With the rise of the digital society, information security has rapidly grown to an area of serious study and ongoing research. While much research has focused on the technical aspects of computer security, far less attention has been given to the management issues of information risk and the economic concerns facing firms and nations. Managing Information Risk and the Economics of Security provides leading edge thinking on the security issues facing managers, policy makers, and individuals. Many of the chapters of this volume were presented and debated at the 2008 Workshop on the Economics of Information Security (WEIS), hosted by the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College. Sponsored by Tuck\u2019s Center for Digital Strategies and the Institute for Information Infrastructure Protection (I3P), the conference brought together over one hundred information security experts, researchers, academics, reporters, corporate executives, government officials, cyber crime investigators and prosecutors. The group represented the global nature of information security with participants from China, Italy, Germany, Canada, Australia, Denmark, Japan, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the US. This volume would not be possible without the dedicated work Xia Zhao (of Dartmouth College and now the University of North Carolina, Greensboro) who acted as the technical editor.",

It charts Indian performance and progress using a unique framework benchmarked against fourteen other countries. In the course of the analysis, critical areas for improvement are identified, and the book provides detailed and objective insights for policy makers and researchers to facilitate change and institutional reform in India. Readers will derive a comprehensive understanding of India's performance and prospects as it emerges as a serious global economic player. A particular feature of the work is the development of an original knowledge footprint concept that measures the extent and impact of knowledge development and diffusion domestic and internationally.

        "description": "Volume 17 of the Australian Dictionary of Biography contains 658 biographies of individuals who died between 1981 and 1990. The first of two volumes for the decade, it presents a colourful mosaic of twentieth-century Australian life. It contains biographies of well-known identities such as Sir Henry Bolte, Sir Robert Askin, Sir Reginald Ansett, Sir Macfarlane Burnet, Sir Raphael and Lady Cilento, Sir Arthur Coles, Robert Holmes-O-Court, Sir Warwick Fairfax, Sir Edmund Herring, Albert Facey, Donald Friend, Sir Roy Grounds, Sir Bernard Heinze and Sir Robert Helpmann. Eminent Australian women in the volume include Dame Elizabeth Couchman, Dame Kate Campbell, Dame Doris Fitton, Dame Zara Holt and Lady (Maie) Casey. Although many of the women achieved prominence in those professions conventionally regarded as the preserve of women, othersandmdash;such as Ruby Boye-Jones, coast-watcher; Ellen Cashman, union organiser; Elsie Chauvel, film-maker; Dorothy Crawford, radio producer; Ruth Dobson, diplomat; Mary Hodgkin, anthropologist; Margaret Kelly, restaurateur; and Patricia Jarrett, journalistandmdash;demonstrate that some women at least were breaking free of the constraints of traditional expectations. The lives of fifteen Indigenous Australians are included, as are those of a number of immigrants who fled from persecution in Europe to establish a new life in Australia.",

Much more than a 'Who's Who', each entry provides an in-depth essay on the life and career of the individual concerned. Essays commence with a quick reference section that provides basic facts on the individual's life and achievements, and conclude with a fully annotated bibliography. The extended biography places the life and works of the individual within an historical context, and the summary at the end of each essay provides a synopsis of the individual's place in history. Any student in the field will want to have one of these as a handy reference companion.",

Al Roker is passionate about food and cooking, but he also knows that spending time with his family is more important than preparing a seven-course meal for Easter dinner. In Al Roker's Hassle-Free Holiday Cookbook, Al presents more than 125 simple and casual recipes that will make your holiday gatherings stress free and special. Here are traditional American favorites for every occasion, from no-cook appetizers and simple side dishes to manageable main courses, and of course, plenty of grilling and outdoor food. And Al has the classics covered -- Thanksgiving turkey with gravy, stuffing, and all the trimmings; splendid Christmas fare, including Crown Pork Roast with Fruit Stuffing and scrumptious and quick gift breads and cookies; satisfying Super Bowl Sunday chili and snacks; a romantic Valentine's Day menu for two; and Halloween treats for adults and kids. Enjoy a Fourth of July picnic of Oven-Fried Chicken with Pecan-Cornmeal Crust accompanied by appetizing salads; honor the patron saint of barbecue on St. Lawrence Day with Texas Brisket and Al's fabulous Grilled Glazed Doughnuts with Vanilla Ice Cream; or try a St. Patrick's Day menu of Irish Stew, Soda Bread, and Bread Pudding with Whiskey Sauce. Al provides his own holiday memories and tells how his family holiday celebrations have evolved over time. There are also a wealth of tips and hints on topics such as how to stock a holiday pantry, carve a turkey, handle leftovers creatively, and cook with kids. Think of Al Roker's Hassle-Free Holiday Cookbook as the one thing you'll need to make each holiday flavorful, easy, and fun -- even for the cook!",

        "description": "Works such as \"The Bell Curve\" imply that any biosocial approach to social science is necessarily Social Darwinist or reactionary. \"Toward a Biocritical Sociology\" suggests the opposite: a biosocial sociology stressing species commonalities opens a site for a distinctively critical social science discourse. Neuhaus shows the relevance of current research in ethology, sociobiology, and evolutionary ethics for the development of a critical biosocial sociology. In developing his own -biocritical- approach, Neuhaus argues that debates over social problems, as well as controversies surrounding the communitarian analyses of Robert Bellah, Amitai Etzioni and Alasdair MacIntyre, may be helpfully analyzed and conceptually unpacked by making use of a critical biosocial perspective.\"",

This figure is about twice the number of people who die in car accidents and five times the number of murder victims annually, and twenty times the number of servicemen and women killed in Iraq and Afghanistan since the start of hostilities in 2001. If you think Americans have the best health-care system in the world, think again. In this deeply researched and controversial book, the author explains why our health-care delivery system serves us so poorly, why it costs so much, and why government policy over many decades has not only failed to improve care delivery but has actually made it worse. In the process, he dispels common misconceptions about medicine and health care. Timely information and a road map to achieve world-class care delivery are shown here - putting health care where it belongs - in the hands of the patient and medical professionals instead of the insurance companies and government.",
