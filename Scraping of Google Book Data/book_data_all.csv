On The Origin Of Stories,Brian Boyd,4.0,1.0,,,"A Century And A Half After The Publication Of Origin Of Species, Evolutionary Thinking Has Expanded Beyond The Field Of Biology To Include Virtually All Human-Related Subjects—Anthropology, Archeology, Psychology, Economics, Religion, Morality, Politics, Culture, And Art. Now A Distinguished Scholar Offers The First Comprehensive Account Of The Evolutionary Origins Of Art And Storytelling. Brian Boyd Explains Why We Tell Stories, How Our Minds Are Shaped To Understand Them, And What Difference An Evolutionary Understanding Of Human Nature Makes To Stories We Love. Art Is A Specifically Human Adaptation, Boyd Argues. It Offers Tangible Advantages For Human Survival, And It Derives From Play, Itself An Adaptation Widespread Among More Intelligent Animals. More Particularly, Our Fondness For Storytelling Has Sharpened Social Cognition, Encouraged Cooperation, And Fostered Creativity. After Considering Art As Adaptation, Boyd Examines Homer’S Odyssey And Dr. Seuss’S Horton Hears A Who! Demonstrating How An Evolutionary Lens Can Offer New Understanding And Appreciation Of Specific Works. What Triggers Our Emotional Engagement With These Works? What Patterns Facilitate Our Responses? The Need To Hold An Audience’S Attention, Boyd Underscores, Is The Fundamental Problem Facing All Storytellers. Enduring Artists Arrive At Solutions That Appeal To Cognitive Universals: An Insight Out Of Step With Contemporary Criticism, Which Obscures Both The Individual And Universal. Published For The Bicentenary Of Darwin’S Birth And The 150Th Anniversary Of The Publication Of Origin Of Species, Boyd’S Study Embraces A Darwinian View Of Human Nature And Art, And Offers A Credo For A New Humanism.",Harvard University Press,555.0,English,2010-11-15,Science Fiction,9780674057111

Editing The Soul,Everett Hamner,,,,,"Personal Genome Testing, Gene Editing For Life-Threatening Diseases, Synthetic Life: Once The Stuff Of Science Fiction, Twentieth- And Twenty-First-Century Advancements Blur The Lines Between Scientific Narrative And Scientific Fact. This Examination Of Bioengineering In Popular And Literary Culture Shows That The Influence Of Science On Science Fiction Is More Reciprocal Than We Might Expect. Looking Closely At The Work Of Margaret Atwood, Richard Powers, And Other Authors, As Well As At Film, Comics, And Serial Television Such As Orphan Black, Everett Hamner Shows How The Genome Age Is Transforming Both The Most Commercial And The Most Sophisticated Stories We Tell About The Core Of Human Personhood. As Sublime Technologies Garner Public Awareness Beyond The Genre Fiction Shelves, They Inspire New Literary Categories Like “Slipstream” And Shape New Definitions Of The Human, The Animal, The Natural, And The Artificial. In Turn, What We Learn Of Bioengineering Via Popular And Literary Culture Prepares The Way For Its Official Adoption Or Restriction—And For Additional Representations. By Imagining The Connections Between Emergent Gene Testing And Editing Capacities And Long-Standing Conversations About Freedom And Determinism, These Stories Help Build A Cultural Zeitgeist With A Sharper, More Balanced Vision Of Predisposed Agency. A Compelling Exploration Of The Interrelationships Among Science, Popular Culture, And Self, Editing The Soul Sheds Vital Light On What The Genome Age Means To Us, And What’S To Come.",Penn State Press,281.0,English,2017-09-28,Science Fiction,9780271080543

Empire Of The Summer Moon Spans Two Astonishing Stories. The First Traces The Rise And Fall Of The Comanches, The Most Powerful Indian Tribe In American History. The Second Entails One Of The Most Remarkable Narratives Ever To Come Out Of The Old West: The Epic Saga Of The Pioneer Woman Cynthia Ann Parker And Her Mixed-Blood Son Quanah, Who Became The Last And Greatest Chief Of The Comanches. Although Readers May Be More Familiar With The Tribal Names Apache And Sioux, It Was In Fact The Legendary Fighting Ability Of The Comanches That Determined When The American West Opened Up. Comanche Boys Became Adept Bareback Riders By Age Six; Full Comanche Braves Were Considered The Best Horsemen Who Ever Rode. They Were So Masterful At War And So Skillful With Their Arrows And Lances That They Stopped The Northern Drive Of Colonial Spain From Mexico And Halted The French Expansion Westward From Louisiana. White Settlers Arriving In Texas From The Eastern United States Were Surprised To Find The Frontier Being Rolled Backward By Comanches Incensed By The Invasion Of Their Tribal Lands. The War With The Comanches Lasted Four Decades, In Effect Holding Up The Development Of The New American Nation.

On A Wintry Delhi Evening On 30 January 1948, Nathuram Godse Shot Gandhi At Point-Blank Range, Forever Silencing The Man Who Had Delivered Independence To His Nation. Godse’S Journey To This Moment Of International Notoriety From Small Towns In Western India Is, By Turns, Both Riveting And Wrenching. Drawing From Previously Unpublished Archival Material, Jha Challenges The Standard Account Of Gandhi’S Assassination, And Offers A Stunning View On The Making Of Independent India. Born To Brahmin Parents, Godse Started Off As A Child Mystic. However, Success Eluded Him. The Caste System Placed Him At The Top Of Society But The Turbulent Times Meant That He Soon Became A Disaffected Youth, Desperately Seeking A Position In The Infant Nation. In Such Confusing Times, Godse Was One Of Hundreds, And Later Thousands, Of Young Indian Men To Be Steered Into The Sheltering Fold Of Early Hindutva, Indian Nationalism. His Association With Early Formations Of The Rss And Far-Right Thinkers Such As Sarvakar Proves That He Was Not Working Alone.

What Are The Gospels?,Richard A. Burridge,,,,,"""The Publication Of Richard Burridge'S What Are The Gospels? In 1992 Inaugurated A Transformation In Gospel Studies By Overturning The Previous Consensus About Gospel Uniqueness. Burridge Argued Convincingly For An Understanding Of The Gospels As Biographies, A Ubiquitous Genre In The Graeco-Roman World. To Establish This Claim, Burridge Compared Each Of The Four Canonical Gospels To The Many Extant Graeco-Roman Biographies. Drawing On Insights From Literary Theory, He Demonstrated That The Previously Widespread View Of The Gospels As Unique Compositions Was False. Burridge Went On To Discuss What A Properly ""Biographical"" Perspective Might Mean For Gospel Interpretation, Which Was Amply Demonstrated In The Revised Second Edition Reflecting On How His View Had Become The New Consensus. This Third, Twenty-Fifth Anniversary Edition Not Only Celebrates The Continuing Influence Of What Are The Gospels?, But Also Features A Major New Contribution In Which Burridge Analyzes Recent Debates And Scholarship About The Gospels. Burridge Both Answers His Critics And Reflects Upon The New Directions Now Being Taken By Those Who Accept The Biographical Approach. This New Edition Also Features As An Appendix A Significant Article In Which He Tackles The Related Problem Of The Genre Of Acts. A Proven Book With Lasting Staying Power, What Are The Gospels?

Don Juan,Lord Byron,,,,,"First Published In 1819, ""Don Juan"" Is Often Acknowledged As One Of Lord Byron'S Greatest Poetic Works. An Epic Poem, Comprised Of Seventeen Cantos That Byron Continued To Work On And Expand Until His Death, ""Don Juan"" Follows The Adventures Of The Famous Spanish Libertine And Reflects Upon Many Of The Romantic And Personal Experiences That Are Universal To All Mankind.

On The Anarchy Of Poetry And Philosophy,Gerald L. Bruns,,,,,"Marcel Duchamp Once Asked Whether It Is Possible To Make Something That Is Not A Work Of Art. This Question Returns Over And Over In Modernist Culture, Where There Are No Longer Any Authoritative Criteria For What Can Be Identified (Or Excluded) As A Work Of Art. As William Carlos Williams Says, A Poem Can Be Made Of Anything, Even Newspaper Clippings.At This Point, Art Turns Into Philosophy, All Art Is Now Conceptual Art, And The Manifesto Becomes The Distinctive Genre Of Modernism. This Book Takes Seriously This Transformation Of Art Into Philosophy, Focusing Upon The Systematic Interest That So Many European Philosophers Take In Modernism. Among The Philosophers Gerald Bruns Discusses Are Theodor W. Adorno, Maurice Blanchot, Arthur Danto, Stanley Cavell, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Michel Foucault, Gilles Deleuze And Felix Guattari, Jacques Derrida, Jean-Franois Lyotard, Jean-Luc Nancy, Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe, And Emmanuel Levinas.As Bruns Demonstrates, The Difficulty Of Much Modern And Contemporary Poetry Can Be Summarized In The Idea That A Poem Is Made Of Words, Not Of Any Of The Things That We Use Words To Produce: Meanings, Concepts, Propositions, Narratives, Or Expressions Of Feeling. Many Modernist Poets Have Argued That In Poetry Language Is No Longer A Form Of Mediation But A Reality To Be Explored And Experienced In Its Own Right. But What Sort Of Experience, Philosophically, Might This Be? The Problem Of The Materiality Or Hermetic Character Of Poetic Language Inevitably Leads To Questions Of How Philosophy Itself Is To Be Written And What Sort Of Communitydefines The Work Of Art-Or, For That Matter, The Work Of Philosophy.In This Provocative Study, Bruns Answers That The Culture Of Modernism Is A Kind Of Anarchist Community, Where The Work Of Art Is Apt To Be As Much An Event Or Experience-Or, Indeed, An Alternative Form Of Life-As A Formal Object. In Modern Writing, Philosophy And Poetry Fold Into One Another. In This Book, Bruns Helps Us To See How.",Fordham Univ Press,274.0,English,2006,Poetry,9780823226320

In This Fascinating Volume, The First Authoritative History Of Indian Food, Lizzie Collingham Reveals That Almost Every Well-Known Indian Dish Is The Product Of A Long History Of Invasion And The Fusion Of Different Food Traditions. We See How, With The Arrival Of Portuguese Explorers And The Mughal Horde, The Cooking Styles And Ingredients Of Central Asia, Persia, And Europe Came To The Subcontinent, Where Over The Next Four Centuries They Mixed With Traditional Indian Food To Produce The Popular Cuisine That We Know Today. Portuguese Spice Merchants, For Example, Introduced Vinegar Marinades And The British Contributed Their Passion For Roast Meat.

The Praise Of Folly,Desiderius Erasmus,,,,,"Erasmus Reached England After A Stay In Italy Early In The Summer Of 1510.

He Had Been Meditating This Piece On The Long Journey From Rome; It Is A Kaleidoscope Of His Experiences In Italy, And Of Earlier Memories. As To The Title, Moria, The Greek Word For ""Folly,"" Was A Playful Allusion, Of Course, To The Name Of His Wise And Witty Host. This ""Praise Of Folly"" Is A Satire, Not Only In The Modern But In The Original Sense Of That Word,—A Medley. All Classes, All Callings, Are Sportively Viewed On The Weak Side. But In Relation To The Author'S Own Life And Times, The Most Important Topics Are The Various Abuses In The Church, The Pedantries Of The School-Men, And The Selfish Wars Of Kings. If This Eloquent Folly, As Erasmus Presents Her, Most Often Wears The Mocking Smile Of Lucian Or Voltaire, There Are Moments Also When She Wields The Terrible Lash Of Juvenal Or Of Swift. The Popularity Of The Satire, Throughout Europe, Was Boundless. The Mask Of Jest Which It Wore Was Its Safeguard; How Undignified, How Absurd It Would Have Been For A Pope Or A King To Care What Was Said By Folly!

They Point Out That Any Assessment Of What “Marriage Equality” Demands Depends On First Determining What Marriage Is—What Sort Of Relationships Must Be Treated As Essentially The Same. They Defend The Principle That Marriage, As A Comprehensive Union Ordered To Family Life, Requires A Man And A Woman. And They Argue For The Great Social Benefits Of Enshrining This Principle In Law. Most Compellingly, They Show That Those Who Embrace Same-Sex Civil Marriage Leave Themselves No Firm Ground—None—For Not Recognizing As Marriages Every Relationship Type Describable In Polite English, Including Multiple-Partner (“Polyamorous”) Sexual Unions. Finally, What Is Marriage? Decisively Answer Common Objections: That The Historic View Is Rooted In Bigotry (Like Laws Forbidding Interracial Marriage); That It Is Callous To People’S Needs; That It Can’T Show The Harm Of Recognizing Same-Sex Couplings, Or The Point Of Recognizing Infertile Ones; And That It Treats A Mere “Social Construct” As If It Were Natural, Or An Unreasoned Religious View As If It Were Rational.",Encounter Books,150.0,English,2012-02-28,Philosophy,9781594036231

Philosophical Explanations,Robert Nozick,3.5,2.0,,,"In This Highly Original Work, Robert Nozick Develops New Views On Philosophy’S Central Topics And Weaves Them Into A Unified Philosophical Perspective.

Writing In A Distinctive And Personal Philosophical Voice, Mr. Nozick Presents A New Mode Of Philosophizing. In Place Of The Usual Semi-Coercive Philosophical Goals Of Proof, Of Forcing People To Accept Conclusions, This Book Seeks Philosophical Explanations And Understanding, And Thereby Stays Truer To The Original Motivations For Being Interested In Philosophy. Combining New Concepts, Daring Hypotheses, Rigorous Reasoning, And Playful Exploration, The Book Exemplifies How Philosophy Can Be Part Of The Humanities.",Harvard University Press,788.0,English,1981,Philosophy,9780674664791

The Crime Of Sylvestre Bonnard,Anatole France,,,,,"I Had Put On My Slippers And My Dressing-Gown. I Wiped Away A Tear With Which The North Wind Blowing Over The Quay Had Obscured My Vision. A Bright Fire Was Leaping In The Chimney Of My Study. Ice-Crystals, Shaped Like Fern-Leaves, Were Sprouting Over The Windowpanes And Concealed From Me The Seine With Its Bridges And The Louvre Of The Valois. I Drew Up My Easy-Chair To The Hearth, And My Table-Volante, And Took Up So Much Of My Place By The Fire As Hamilcar Deigned To Allow Me. Hamilcar Was Lying In Front Of The Andirons, Curled Up On A Cushion, With His Nose Between His Paws. His Think Find Fur Rose And Fell With His Regular Breathing. At My Coming, He Slowly Slipped A Glance Of His Agate Eyes At Me From Between His Half-Opened Lids, Which He Closed Again Almost At Once, Thinking To Himself, ""It Is Nothing; It Is Only My Friend."" ""Hamilcar,"" I Said To Him, As I Stretched My Legsñ""Hamilcar, Somnolent Prince Of The City Of Booksñthou Guardian Nocturnal! Like That Divine Cat Who Combated The Impious In Heliopolisñin The Night Of The Great Combatñthou Dost Defend From Vile Nibblers Those Books Which The Old Savant Acquired At The Cost Of His Slender Savings And Indefatigable Zeal. Sleep, Hamilcar, Softly As A Sultana, In This Library, That Shelters Thy Military Virtues; For Verily In Thy Person Are United The Formidable Aspect Of A Tatar Warrior And The Slumbrous Grace Of A Woman Of The Orient. Sleep, Thou Heroic And Voluptuous Hamilcar, While Awaiting The Moonlight Hour In Which The Mice Will Come Forth To Dance Before The Acta Sanctorum Of The Learned Bolandists!"" The Beginning Of This Discourse Pleased Hamilcar, Who Accompanied It With A Throat-Sound Like The Song Of A Kettle On The Fire. But As My Voice Waxed Louder, Hamilcar Notified Me By Lowering His Ears And By Wrinkling The Striped Skin Of His Brow That It Was Bad Taste On My Part So To Declaim. ""This Old-Book Man,"" Evidently Thought Hamilcar, ""Talks To No Purpose At All While Our Housekeeper Never Utters A Word Which Is Not Full Of Good Sense, Full Of Significanceñcontaining Either The Announcement Of A Meal Or The Promise Of A Whipping. One Knows What She Says. But This Old Man Puts Together A Lot Of Sounds Signifying Nothing."" So Thought Hamilcar To Himself. Leaving Him To His Reflections, I Opened A Book, Which I Began To Read With Interest; For It Was A Catalogue Of Manuscripts. I Do Not Know Any Reading More Easy, More Fascinating, More Delightful Than That Of A Catalogue. The One Which I Was Readingñedited In 1824 By Mr. Thompson, Librarian To Sir Thomas Raleighñsins, It Is True, By Excess Of Brevity, And Does Not Offer That Character Of Exactitude Which The Archivists Of My Own Generation Were The First To Introduce Into Works Upon Diplomatics And Paleography. It Leaves A Good Deal To Be Desired And To Be Divined. This Is Perhaps Why I Find Myself Aware, While Reading It, Of A State Of Mind Which In Nature More Imaginative Than Mine Might Be Called Reverie. I Had Allowed Myself To Drift Away This Gently Upon The Current Of My Thoughts, When My Housekeeper Announced, In A Tone Of Ill-Humor, That Monsieur Coccoz Desired To Speak With Me.",Library Of Alexandria,,English,2015-10-26,"Fiction , Crime",9781465542076
The History And Romance Of Crime: Non-Criminal Prisons,Arthur George Frederick Griffiths,,,,,"The Three Principal Prisons In London In The Fourteenth Century Were The Fleet, The Kingõs Bench And The Marshalsea, But Newgate Took Precedence In Interest Because Identified With Its Earliest History. All Have Their Peculiar Histories Full Of Interesting Associations, Replete With Memories Of Famous Inmates And Striking Incidents, And All Are Worthy Of Detailed Description. All Alike Received Prisoners For Debt And On Occasion, More Heinous Offenders, Especially In The Earlier Years Of Their Existence. The Old Kingõs Bench Was The Peculiar Prison For The Court Of That Name, But It Also Took Debtors Committed By The Court Of Exchequer And The Court Of Common Pleas. The Marshalsea Court, So Called From Having Been Originally Under The Control Of The Knight Marshal Of The Royal Household, Was At First Intended To Settle Differences Between The Lesser Servants Of The Palace, And Had Its Own Judge, Counsel And Attorneys, But None Except Members Of Cliffordõs Inn Were Permitted To Practise In This Court. The Jurisdiction Of This Court Extended Twelve Miles Round Whitehall, Excluding The City Of London. It Also Served The Admiralty Court And Received Prisoners Charged With Piracy. The Fleet Prison Took Its Name From The Little Stream Long Stigmatised As The Òfleet Ditch,Ó The Open Sewer Or Water-Way Which Rose In The Eastern Ridge Of Hampstead Hill, Flowed By Òoldbourneó Or Holborn Under Four Bridges To Discharge Into The Thames On The West Side Of Blackfriars Bridge. As Time Passed This Ditch, After Being Deepened Once Or Twice To Allow For Water Traffic, Became More And More Pestilential And Was At Length Filled Up And Arched Over, Becoming Then The Site Of Fleet Market In What Is Now Known As Farringdon Street, On Which The Main Gates Of The Prison Opened. The Building Was Of Great Antiquity And Is First Mentioned In Authentic Records About A. D. 1197. A Deed Of That Date Granted It To The Safe Keeping Of One Nathaniel De Leveland And His Son Robert, In Conjunction With The Kingõs Houses At Westminster. It Is Stated That The Fleet Prison Had Been The Inheritance Of The Levelands Since The Time Of The Norman Conquest. Four Years Later This Same Robert De Leveland Petitioned King John For Leave To Hand Over The Wardenship Of The Fleet To Simon Fitz-Robert, Archdeacon Of Wells, While He, Leveland, Proceeded With The Crusaders To The Holy Land. He Returned Very Shortly Afterward, As Appears From A Grant Of Moneys Made Him By The City Of London In 1205, His Salary For Guardianship Of The Prison.

Willpower Doesn'T Work Is An Insightful Guide To Help Us Thrive In Today'S World' Arianna Huffington If You'Re Relying On Willpower Alone To Help You Lose Weight, Improve Your Relationships Or Achieve More At Work, You'Re Doomed To Fail. The Environment Around Us Is Far Too Powerful, Stimulating, Addicting And Stressful To Overcome It Through Sheer Determination. Willpower, Grit, Being Positive - Basically, All The Tools You'Ve Been Told Are The Keys To Creating Lasting Change In Your Life - Are Insufficient In This High-Paced, Information-Overloaded World We Live In.

From Simple Steps Like Removing Things That Conflict With Your Values From Your Environment (Like Junk Food, Junk Media, Even Junk People), To Incorporating New Tools (Like Fasting Or Adding 'Positive Triggers' To Your World), These Lessons Make It Possible To Consciously Shape Your Surroundings So You Can Lead A More Productive And Happier Life.

The Art Of Being Better,Eugene X. Perticone,,,,,"The Goal Of This Book Is To Stimulate An Awareness Of A Person'S Authentic Self. For Those Who Would Choose To Embark Or Continue On The Simple But Often Difficult Path Of Being Better, The Author Presents A Remarkably Clear And Practical Guide That Can Be Of Immense Benefit To Anyone Who Aspires To Grow In Living Life More Fully And Authentically.

These Are Presented And Discussed Sequentially, And These Concepts Should Be Applied Practically In Day-To-Day Life To Learn Their Meaning And Value. A Series Of Fifty-Nine Process Activities Are Included, Exploring Empirically And Experientially The Validity That Learning And Being Better Are Actions, Not Merely Ideas. At Each Step, These Activities Consider, Refine, And Validate Notions Of Who And What We Are And How To Be Better.

Edwin Mansfield (1971, Pp. 1- 2), A Pioneer In The Economics Of Technological Change, Noted: Technological Change Is An Important, If Not The Most Important, Factor Responsible For Economic Growth . . . Without Question, [It] Is One Of The Most Important Determinants Of The Shape And Evolution Of The American Economy. Science And Technology Are Even More Important In The ""New Economy,"" With Its Greater Emphasis On The Role Of Intellectual Property And Knowledge Transfer. Therefore, It Is Unfortunate That Most Individuals Rarely Have The Opportunity To Explore The Economic Implications Of Science And Technology. As A Result, The Antecedents And Consequences Of Technological Change Are Poorly Understood By Many In The General Public. This Lack Of Understanding Is Reflected In A Recent Survey Conducted By The National Science Board (2000), Summarized In Science & Engineering Indicators. ' As Shown In Table 1. 1, The Findings Of The Survey Indicated That Many Americans, Despite A High Level Of Interests In Such Matters, Are Not As Well-Informed About Technological Issues As They Are About Other Policy Issues. As Shown In The Table, Individuals Self Assess, Based On A Scale From 1 To 100, Their Interest In Science And Technology Policy Issues As Being Relatively High, Yet They Self Assess Their Knowledge Or Informedness About These Issues Relatively Lower.",Springer Science & Business Media,135.0,English,2012-12-06,"Business & Economics , General",9781461509813

The Great Gatsby,F. Scott Fitzgerald,,,,,"The Great Gatsby Is A 1925 Novel Written By American Author F. Scott Fitzgerald That Follows A Cast Of Characters Living In The Fictional Town Of West Egg On Prosperous Long Island In The Summer Of 1922. The Story Primarily Concerns The Young And Mysterious Millionaire Jay Gatsby And His Quixotic Passion And Obsession For The Beautiful Former Debutante Daisy Buchanan. Considered To Be Fitzgerald'S Magnum Opus, The Great Gatsby Explores Themes Of Decadence, Idealism, Resistance To Change, Social Upheaval, And Excess, Creating A Portrait Of The Jazz Age Or The Roaring Twenties That Has Been Described As A Cautionary Tale Regarding The American Dream. Fitzgerald-Inspired By The Parties He Had Attended While Visiting Long Island'S North Shore-Began Planning The Novel In 1923, Desiring To Produce, In His Words, """"Something New-Something Extraordinary And Beautiful And Simple And Intricately Patterned."""" Progress Was Slow, With Fitzgerald Completing His First Draft Following A Move To The French Riviera In 1924. His Editor, Maxwell Perkins, Felt The Book Was Vague And Persuaded The Author To Revise Over The Next Winter. Fitzgerald Was Repeatedly Ambivalent About The Book'S Title And He Considered A Variety Of Alternatives, Including Titles That Referenced The Roman Character Trimalchio; The Title He Was Last Documented To Have Desired Was Under The Red, White, And Blue. In Its First Year, The Book Sold Only 20,000 Copies. Fitzgerald Died In 1940, Believing Himself To Be A Failure And His Work Forgotten. However, The Novel Experienced A Revival During World War Ii, And Became A Part Of American High School Curricula And Numerous Stage And Film Adaptations In The Following Decades. Today, The Great Gatsby Is Widely Considered To Be A Literary Classic And A Contender For The Title """"Great American Novel.""""

In The Grammar Of Our Culture There Seems To Be An Accepted Opinion That Print Is Superior In Terms Of Cultural Production To Film, Radio Or Television, That To Read A Book Is Somehow A 'Higher' Cultural Activity Than Seeing A Play On Television Or Seeing A Film. By The Same Token, A Novel Is A 'Superior' Work Of Art To Film Or Television.

It Serves As A Departure From The 'Death Of The Author' Thesis By Reconsidering The Role Of The Author In African Literature And Culture Industry, As Well As The Influence Of African Publics On Writers’ Aesthetic Choices, And On The Overall Processes Of Production.

With The Warded Man And The Desert Spear, Peter V. Brett Surged To The Front Rank Of Contemporary Fantasy, Standing Alongside Giants In The Field Such As George R. R. Martin, Robert Jordan, And Terry Brooks. The Daylight War, The Eagerly Anticipated Third Volume In Brett’S Internationally Bestselling Demon Cycle, Continues The Epic Tale Of Humanity’S Last Stand Against An Army Of Demons That Rise Each Night To Prey On Mankind.

 On The Night Of The New Moon, The Demons Rise In Force, Seeking The Deaths Of Two Men, Both Of Whom Have The Potential To Become The Fabled Deliverer, The Man Prophesied To Reunite The Scattered Remnants Of Humanity In A Final Push To Destroy The Demon Corelings Once And For All.

 Arlen Bales Was Once An Ordinary Man, But Now He Has Become Something More—The Warded Man, Tattooed With Eldritch Wards So Powerful They Make Him A Match For Any Demon. Arlen Denies He Is The Deliverer At Every Turn, But The More He Tries To Be One With The Common Folk, The More Fervently They Believe. Many Would Follow Him, But Arlen’S Path Threatens To Lead To A Dark Place He Alone Can Travel To, And From Which There May Be No Returning.

 The Only One With Hope Of Keeping Arlen In The World Of Men, Or Joining Him In His Descent Into The World Of Demons, Is Renna Tanner, A Fierce Young Woman In Danger Of Losing Herself To The Power Of Demon Magic.

 Ahmann Jardir Has Forged The Warlike Desert Tribes Of Krasia Into A Demon-Killing Army And Proclaimed Himself Shar’Dama Ka, The Deliverer. He Carries Ancient Weapons—A Spear And A Crown—That Give Credence To His Claim, And Already Vast Swaths Of The Green Lands Bow To His Control.

 But Jardir Did Not Come To Power On His Own. His Rise Was Engineered By His First Wife, Inevera, A Cunning And Powerful Priestess Whose Formidable Demon Bone Magic Gives Her The Ability To Glimpse The Future. Inevera’S Motives And Past Are Shrouded In Mystery, And Even Jardir Does Not Entirely Trust Her.

 Once Arlen And Jardir Were As Close As Brothers. Now They Are The Bitterest Of Rivals. As Humanity’S Enemies Rise, The Only Two Men Capable Of Defeating Them Are Divided Against Each Other By The Most Deadly Demons Of All—Those Lurking In The Human Heart.

He Was Framed For Murder.
 Now He Needs A Miracle. 
 
 22 Years Ago Quincy Miller Was Sentenced To Life Without Parole. He Was Accused Of Killing Keith Russo, A Lawyer In A Small Florida Town. But There Were No Reliable Witnesses And Little Motive. Just The Fact That Russo Had Botched Quincy'S Divorce Case, That Quincy Was Black In A Largely All-White Town And That A Blood-Splattered Torch Was Found In The Boot Of Quincy'S Car. A Torch He Swore Was Planted. A Torch That Was Conveniently Destroyed In A Fire Just Before His Trial. The Lack Of Evidence Made No Difference To Judge Or Jury. In The Eyes Of The Law Quincy Was Guilty And, No Matter How Often He Protested His Innocence, His Punishment Was Life In Prison. Finally, After 22 Years, Comes Quincy'S One And Only Chance Of Freedom. An Innocence Lawyer And Minister, Cullen Post, Takes On His Case. Post Has Exonerated Eight Men In The Last Ten Years. He Intends To Make Quincy The Next. But There Were Powerful And Ruthless People Behind Russo'S Murder. They Prefer That An Innocent Man Dies In Jail Rather Than One Of Them. There'S One Way To Guarantee That. They Killed One Lawyer 22 Years Ago, And They'Ll Kill Another Without A Second Thought.

Porter’S Groundbreaking Study Of International Competitiveness Has Shaped National Policy In Countries Around The World. It Has Also Transformed Thinking And Action In States, Cities, Companies, And Even Entire Regions Such As Central America.

Based On Research In Ten Leading Trading Nations, The Competitive Advantage Of Nations Offers The First Theory Of Competitiveness Based On The Causes Of The Productivity With Which Companies Compete. Porter Shows How Traditional Comparative Advantages Such As Natural Resources And Pools Of Labor Have Been Superseded As Sources Of Prosperity, And How Broad Macroeconomic Accounts Of Competitiveness Are Insufficient. The Book Introduces Porter’S “Diamond,” A Whole New Way To Understand The Competitive Position Of A Nation (Or Other Locations) In Global Competition That Is Now An Integral Part Of International Business Thinking. Porter'S Concept Of “Clusters,” Or Groups Of Interconnected Firms, Suppliers, Related Industries, And Institutions That Arise In Particular Locations, Has Become A New Way For Companies And Governments To Think About Economies, Assess The Competitive Advantage Of Locations, And Set Public Policy.
 
Even Before Publication Of The Book, Porter’S Theory Had Guided National Reassessments In New Zealand And Elsewhere. His Ideas And Personal Involvement Have Shaped Strategy In Countries As Diverse As The Netherlands, Portugal, Taiwan, Costa Rica, And India, And Regions Such As Massachusetts, California, And The Basque Country.

Using Tough Benchmarks, Collins And His Research Team Identified A Set Of Elite Companies That Made The Leap To Great Results And Sustained Those Results For At Least Fifteen Years. How Great? After The Leap, The Good-To-Great Companies Generated Cumulative Stock Returns That Beat The General Stock Market By An Average Of Seven Times In Fifteen Years, Better Than Twice The Results Delivered By A Composite Index Of The World'S Greatest Companies, Including Coca-Cola, Intel, General Electric, And Merck.The Comparisons 
The Research Team Contrasted The Good-To-Great Companies With A Carefully Selected Set Of Comparison Companies That Failed To Make The Leap From Good To Great. What Was Different? Why Did One Set Of Companies Become Truly Great Performers While The Other Set Remained Only Good? Over Five Years, The Team Analyzed The Histories Of All Twenty-Eight Companies In The Study. After Sifting Through Mountains Of Data And Thousands Of Pages Of Interviews, Collins And His Crew Discovered The Key Determinants Of Greatness -- Why Some Companies Make The Leap And Others Don'T. The Findings
 The Findings Of The Good To Great Study Will Surprise Many Readers And Shed Light On Virtually Every Area Of Management Strategy And Practice. The Findings Include:Level 5 Leaders: The Research Team Was Shocked To Discover The Type Of Leadership Required To Achieve Greatness. The Hedgehog Concept (Simplicity Within The Three Circles): To Go From Good To Great Requires Transcending The Curse Of Competence. A Culture Of Discipline: When You Combine A Culture Of Discipline With An Ethic Of Entrepreneurship, You Get The Magical Alchemy Of Great Results. Technology Accelerators: Good-To-Great Companies Think Differently About The Role Of Technology. The Flywheel And The Doom Loop: Those Who Launch Radical Change Programs And Wrenching Restructurings Will Almost Certainly Fail To Make The Leap.“Some Of The Key Concepts Discerned In The Study,” Comments Jim Collins, ""Fly In The Face Of Our Modern Business Culture And Will, Quite Frankly, Upset Some People.” Perhaps, But Who Can Afford To Ignore These Findings?",Harper Collins,320.0,English,2011-07-19,"Business &Amp, Economics , Management",9780062119209

 Ray Dalio, One Of The World’S Most Successful Investors And Entrepreneurs, Shares The Unconventional Principles That He’S Developed, Refined, And Used Over The Past Forty Years To Create Unique Results In Both Life And Business—And Which Any Person Or Organization Can Adopt To Help Achieve Their Goals.

In 1975, Ray Dalio Founded An Investment Firm, Bridgewater Associates, Out Of His Two-Bedroom Apartment In New York City. Forty Years Later, Bridgewater Has Made More Money For Its Clients Than Any Other Hedge Fund In History And Grown Into The Fifth Most Important Private Company In The United States, According To Fortune Magazine. Dalio Himself Has Been Named To Time Magazine’S List Of The 100 Most Influential People In The World. Along The Way, Dalio Discovered A Set Of Unique Principles That Have Led To Bridgewater’S Exceptionally Effective Culture, Which He Describes As “An Idea Meritocracy That Strives To Achieve Meaningful Work And Meaningful Relationships Through Radical Transparency.” It Is These Principles, And Not Anything Special About Dalio—Who Grew Up An Ordinary Kid In A Middle-Class Long Island Neighborhood—That He Believes Are The Reason Behind His Success.
 
 In Principles, Dalio Shares What He’S Learned Over The Course Of His Remarkable Career. He Argues That Life, Management, Economics, And Investing Can All Be Systemized Into Rules And Understood Like Machines. The Book’S Hundreds Of Practical Lessons, Which Are Built Around His Cornerstones Of “Radical Truth” And “Radical Transparency,” Include Dalio Laying Out The Most Effective Ways For Individuals And Organizations To Make Decisions, Approach Challenges, And Build Strong Teams. He Also Describes The Innovative Tools The Firm Uses To Bring An Idea Meritocracy To Life, Such As Creating “Baseball Cards” For All Employees That Distill Their Strengths And Weaknesses, And Employing Computerized Decision-Making Systems To Make Believability-Weighted Decisions. While The Book Brims With Novel Ideas For Organizations And Institutions, Principles Also Offers A Clear, Straightforward Approach To Decision-Making That Dalio Believes Anyone Can Apply, No Matter What They’Re Seeking To Achieve.

Updated: Includes The Best Habit Tracking Apps Of 2017.Lasting Change For Early Quitters, Burnouts, The Unmotivated, And Everyone Else Too 

When I Decided To Start Exercising Consistently 10 Years Ago, This Is What Actually Happened: I Tried ""Getting Motivated."" It Worked Sometimes.I Tried Setting Audacious Big Goals. I Almost Always Failed Them.I Tried To Make Changes Last. They Didn'T.Like Most People Who Try To Change And Fail, I Assumed That I Was The Problem.

Then One Afternoon--After Another Failed Attempt To Get Motivated To Exercise--I (Accidentally) Started My First Mini Habit. I Initially Committed To Do One Push-Up, And It Turned Into A Full Workout. I Was Shocked. This ""Stupid Idea"" Wasn'T Supposed To Work. I Was Shocked Again When My Success With This Strategy Continued For Months (And To This Day).

I Had To Consider That Maybe I Wasn'T The Problem In Those 10 Years Of Mediocre Results. Maybe It Was My Prior Strategies That Were Ineffective, Despite Being Oft-Repeated As ""The Way To Change"" In Countless Books And Blogs.

My Suspicions Were Correct.

Is There A Scientific Explanation For This?
As I Sought Understanding, I Found A Plethora Of Scientific Studies That Had Answers, With Nobody To Interpret Them Correctly. Based On The Science--Which You'Ll Find Peppered Throughout Mini Habits--We'Ve Been Doing It All Wrong.

You Can Succeed Without The Guilt, Intimidation, And Repeated Failure Associated With Such Strategies As ""Getting Motivated,"" New Year'S Resolutions, Or Even ""Just Doing It."" In Fact, You Need To Stop Using Those Strategies If They Aren'T Giving You Great Results.

Most Popular Strategies Don'T Work Well Because They Require You To Fight Against Your Subconscious Brain (A Fight Not Easily Won). It'S Only When You Start Playing By Your Brain'S Rules And Taking Your Human Limitations Seriously--As Mini Habits Show You How To Do--That You Can Achieve Lasting Change.

What'S A Mini Habit?
A Mini Habit Is A Very Small Positive Behavior That You Force Yourself To Do Every Day; Its ""Too Small To Fail"" Nature Makes It Weightless, Deceptively Powerful, And A Superior Habit-Building Strategy. You Will Have No Choice But To Believe In Yourself When You'Re Always Moving Forward.

The Barrier To The First Step Is So Low That Even Depressed Or ""Stuck"" People Can Find Early Success And Begin To Reverse Their Lives Right Away. And If You Think One Push-Up A Day Is Too Small To Matter, I'Ve Got One Heck Of A Story For You!

Aim For The First Step
They Say When You Aim For The Moon, You'Ll Land Among The Stars. Well, That Doesn'T Make Sense, As The Moon Is Closer Than The Stars. I Digress. 

The Message Is That You Should Aim Very High And Even If You Fall Short, You'Ll Still Get Somewhere. I'Ve Found The Opposite To Be True In Regards To Productivity And Healthy Behaviors. When You Aim For The Moon, You Won'T Do Anything Because It'S Too Far Away. But When You Aim For The Step In Front Of You, You Might Keep Going And Reach The Moon.

I'Ve Used The Mini Habits Strategy To Get Into The Best Shape Of My Life, Read 10X More Books, And Write 4X As Many Words. It Started From Requiring One Push-Up From Myself Every Day. How Ridiculous Is That? Not So Ridiculous When You Consider The Science Of The Brain, Habits, And Willpower.

The Mini Habits System Works Because It'S How Our Brains Are Designed To Change.

Note: This Book Isn'T For Eliminating Bad Habits (Some Principles Could Be Useful For Breaking Habits). Mini Habits Is A Strategy To Create Permanent Healthy Habits In: Exercise, Writing, Reading, Thinking Positively, Meditating, Drinking Water, Eating Healthy Foods, Etc.

Lasting Change Won'T Happen Until You Take That First Step Into A Strategy That Works. Give Mini Habits A Try. You Won'T Look Back.",Selective Entertainment Llc,126.0,English,2013-12-22,None,9780996435420

Introduction To Psychoanalysis Is A Set Of Lectures Given By Sigmund Freud 1915-17, Which Became The Most Popular And Widely Translated Of His Works.

In The Book Dream Psychology: Psychoanalysis For Beginners Freud Explains The Buried Meanings Inside Dreams, Particularly The Drive And The Connection Between The Unconscious And Conscious, Blocked Sexual Cravings, And The Significance Of Dreams To Our Overall Well-Being. Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) Was An Austrian Neurologist And The Father Of Psychoanalysis, A Clinical Method For Treating Psychopathology Through Dialogue Between A Patient And A Psychoanalyst. In Creating Psychoanalysis, Freud Developed Therapeutic Techniques Such As The Use Of Free Association And Discovered Transference, Establishing Its Central Role In The Analytic Process. Freud'S Redefinition Of Sexuality To Include Its Infantile Forms Led Him To Formulate The Oedipus Complex As The Central Tenet Of Psychoanalytical Theory.

The Complete Art Of War,Sun Tzu,4.7,110,7.84,SAR,"Collected Here In This 4-In-1 Omnibus Are The Most Important Books Ever Written On The Art Of War. The Art Of War By Sun Tzu Translated And Commented On By Lionel Giles, On War By Carl Von Clausewitz, The Art Of War By Niccolò Machiavelli, And The Art Of War By Baron De Jomini. These Four Books Will Give You As Complete A View On The Art Of War As You Can Attain. This Is The Most Important Book Ever Written About Warfare And Conflict. Lionel Giles' Translation Is The Definitive Edition And His Commentary Is Indispensable. The Art Of War Can Be Used And Adapted In Every Facet Of Your Life. This Book Explains When And How To Go To War, As Well As When Not To. Learn How To Win Any Conflict Whether It Be On The Battlefield Or In The Boardroom. Although Carl Von Clausewitz Participated In Many Military Campaigns, He Was Primarily A Military Theorist Interested In The Examination Of War. On War Is The West'S Premier Work On The Philosophy Of War. Other Soldiers Before Him Had Written Treatises On Various Military Subjects, But None Undertook A Great Philosophical Examination Of War On The Scale Of Clausewitz'S. On War Is Considered To Be The First Modern Book Of Military Strategy. This Is Due Mainly To Clausewitz' Integration Of Political, Social, And Economic Issues As Some Of The Most Important Factors In Deciding The Outcomes Of A War. It Is One Of The Most Important Treatises On Strategy Ever Written, And Continues To Be Required Reading At Many Military Academies. Niccolo Machiavelli Considered This Book His Greatest Achievement. Here You Will Learn How To Recruit, Train, Motivate, And Discipline An Army. You Will Learn The Difference Between Strategy And Tactics. Machiavelli Does A Masterful Job Of Breaking Down And Analyzing Historic Battles. This Book Of Military Knowledge Belongs Alongside Sun-Tzu And Clausewitz On Every Book Shelf. Antoine-Henri Jomini Was The Most Celebrated Writer On The Napoleonic Art Of War. Jomini Was Present At Most Of The Most Important Battles Of The Napoleonic Wars. His Writing, Therefore, Is The Most Authoritative On The Subject. ""The Art Of War, As Generally Considered, Consists Of Five Purely Military Branches,-Viz.: Strategy, Grand Tactics, Logistics, Engineering, And Tactics. A Sixth And Essential Branch, Hitherto Unrecognized, Might Be Termed Diplomacy In Its Relation To War. Although This Branch Is More Naturally And Intimately Connected With The Profession Of A Statesman Than With That Of A Soldier, It Cannot Be Denied That, If It Be Useless To A Subordinate General, It Is Indispensable To Every General Commanding An Army."" -Antoine-Henri Jomini",Simon And Schuster,667.0,English,2013-04-29,"Political Science , Political Ideologies , General",9781627931502

New Perspectives On Industrial Organization,"Victor J. Tremblay', 'Carol Horton Tremblay",,,,,"This Book Covers The Main Topics That Students Need To Learn In A Course On Industrial Organization. It Reviews The Classic Models And Important Empirical Evidence Related To The Field. However, It Will Differ From Prior Textbooks In Two Ways. First, This Book Incorporates Contributions From Behavioral Economics And Neuroeconomics, Providing The Reader With A Richer Understanding Of Consumer Preferences And The Motivation For Many Of The Business Practices We See Today. The Book Discusses How Firms Exploit Consumers Who Are Prone To Making Mistakes And Who Suffer From Cognitive Dissonance, Attention Lapses, And Bounded Rationality, For Example And Will Help Explain Why Firms Invest In Persuasive Advertising, Offer 30-Day Free Trials, Offer Money-Back Guarantees, And Engage In Other Observed Phenomena That Cannot Be Explained By The Traditional Approaches To Industrial Organization. A Second Difference Is That This Book Achieves A Balance Between Textbooks That Emphasize Formal Modeling And Those That Emphasize The History Of The Field, Empirical Evidence, Case Studies, And Policy Analysis. This Text Puts More Emphasis On The Micro-Foundations (I.E., Consumer And Producer Theory), Classic Game Theoretic Models, And Recent Contributions From Behavioral Economics That Are Pertinent To Industrial Organization. Each Topic Will Begin With A Discussion Of Relevant Theory And Models And Will Also Include A Discussion Of Concrete Examples, Empirical Evidence, And Evidence From Case Studies. This Will Provide Students With A Deeper Understanding Of Firm And Consumer Behavior, Of The Factors That Influence Market Structure And Economic Performance, And Of Policy Issues Involving Imperfectly Competitive Markets. The Book Is Intended To Be A Textbook For Graduate Students, Mbas And Upper-Level Undergraduates And Will Use Examples, Graphical Analysis, Algebra, And Simple Calculus To Explain Important Ideas And Theories In Industrial Organization.",Springer Science & Business Media,811.0,English,2012-07-20,"Business &Amp, Economics , Motivational",9781461432418

A – If You Want The Honest Answer I Wrote It For Me. As A Reader, I Love British Satire And Humor (Or Humour). I Love Wit; Funny Epic Fantasy Series Like The Discworld Novels And Comedic Sci Fi Like Douglas Adams. I Like Sff And Speculative Fiction, I Like Adventure And Action And A Gripping Tale That Zips Along Quickly, I Like Genre Mash Ups And I Love An Angsty Dystopian World. However, The Best Science Fiction And Fantasy Stories, For Me, Are Funny. I Aim To Write Comedy In The Tradition Of All The Great Humorous British Authors. I Like To Aim High. I Wanted Protagonists People Could Love And Empathise With, Mavericks, Misfit Characters, Real People ... Except They'Re Not All People Obviously, Some Of Them Are Other Alien (Ish) Species. This Book Is About Misfit Heroes And Heroines Winning The Day, It’S About Good Versus Evil Even When The Good Guys Are On Different Sides. It'S Dystopian Science Fiction Fantasy Action - It'S Dystopia But It'S Comedy, It'S Sci-Fi But It'S Planet-Based. You'Ll Find All Sorts Of Quirky Characters And Interesting Alien Species: From 6Ft Swamp Things With Antennae To Cute Furry Creatures Like The Blurpons, With Their Fluffy Ears, Big Button Eyes And Penchant For Extreme Violence. Oh ... And Did I Mention The Flying Car Chases? Q – Do Our Readers Have To Read The K’Barthan Series In Order? A – Yes Otherwise The Character Development – And Some Of The Technology – Will Make Less Sense The Books Go In This Order: - Unlucky Dip, K'Barthan Series: Prequel ** - Few Are Chosen, K'Barthan Series: Part 1 - This Book ** - The Wrong Stuff, K'Barthan Series: Part 2 - One Man: No Plan, K'Barthan Series: Part 3 - Looking For Trouble, K'Barthan Series: Part 4 **** Similar Authors: Robert Rankin, C Gockel, Patty Jansen, Jj Greene, Fj Savage, Heide Goodey, Em Foner, Robert Asprin, The Stainless Steel Rat And Space Team Series.

International Economics,Lawrence A. Officer,,,,,"International Economics Is Unique Despite The Existence Of Numerous Books Of The Same Title. It Is True That No One Volume Can Capture The Entire State Of The Art Of The Subject, But Individuals Can Apply Their Own Perspectives To Identify Crucial Issues In The Development Of The Field. Therefore, Rather Than Instructions To Prepare ""Surveys"" Of Subfields Within International Economics, The Contributors To This Book Were Informed As Follows: Your Essay Should Present An Affirmative But Constructively Critical Look At Your Subject. It Is Not Meant To Be A Survey. Rather, Your Task Is To Pinpoint Crucial Areas Of Development, To Offer A Critical Evaluation Of What'S Going On In The Field And Where It Might Go. Your Contribution Would Be Your Own Personal Statement Of How You See Things. It Should Be Written At The Professional Level. Beyond These General Guidelines, You May Develop Your Essay As You See Fit. How Much Of ""International Economics"" Should Be Assigned To Each Author And How Many Contributions The Book Should Have, Required Careful Consideration. Traditionally, International Economics Has Been Divided Into Pure Theory And Monetary Theory, Suggesting A Simple Division Of The Field; But This Dichotomy Has Been Overturned By The Emergence Of Litera Ture That Overlaps Both Theories. An Opposite Approach Would Have Been To Separate International Economics Into Twelve To Fifteen Areas, Each With A Contributor. This Procedure Divides The Field Into Too Many Parts And, Consequently, Overlapping Threads Of Development Would Be Ignored.",Springer Science & Business Media,274.0,English,2012-12-06,"Business &Amp, Economics , Personal Finance , General",9789400932630

Proceedings Of The International Conference On Business And Management Dynamics 2016,,,,,,"Cape Town, South Africa, 7 Sept. 2016 - 8 Sept. 2016. Theme: Sustainable Economies In The Information Economy. Purpose: To Share The Quality Academic Papers Presented At The International Conference On Business And Management Dynamics (Icbmd) Held From 7 To 8 September 2016 At African Pride Crystal Hotel And Spa In Cape Town. As Grey Literature, The Proceedings Are The Contributions Made By Researchers At The Conference And Are Considered The Written Record Of The Work That Was Presented To Fellow Conference Delegates. Methodology: The Methodology Used Varies From Researcher To Researcher But Are Suitable For The Studies Conducted. Thus, On The One Hand, Studies That Were Subjective In Nature Used The Interpretive Paradigm, Where The Qualitative Approach Adopted Made Used Of The Interview Method To Collect Data. On The Other Hand, Studies That Were Objectively Inclined Adopted The Positivist Philosophy And Used Survey Questionnaires To Collect Data. However, There Were Some Academic Papers Which Used Mixed Methodology Because Of The Nature Of The Study. Whatever Methodology Used Adhered To The Ethos Of The Philosophies Underpinning The Methodology. Contribution Made To Scholarship: The Articles Come From Individual Researchers And Each Article In The Proceedings Is Unique. Mostly, There Is No General Argument Leading From One Contribution To The Next. However, It Is Interesting To Note That In The Area Of Economic Performance It Was Evident That Real Exchange Rate And Net Foreign Direct Investment Contribute More Towards Innovations In Economic Growth. With Regard To Human Capital Development, Papers Presented Evidence That There Exists A Definite Need To Explore The Phenomenon Of Personal Branding As Limited Scientific Academic Research Has Been Done Within The Field Of Personal Branding Or On Elements Of The Topic. Thus, The Outcome Argues That Personal Branding Has An Influence On Leadership Style Which In Turn Impacts On Organisational Performance And Related Hygiene Factors. Furthermore, It Was Demonstrated That Current Methods Or Strategies For Enforcing Institutionalisation Of Knowledge Sharing Within An Organisation Have Not Been Successful, And, As Such, New Strategies Are Needed To Reinforce Efforts To Nurture And Invigorate The Institutionalisation Of Knowledge Sharing Within An Organisation. With Regard To Technology And Big Data Impact On Organisational Performance, It Was Evident That System Performance, Memory Consumption And Cpu Utilisation Can Be Used As Criteria To Compare And Evaluate Big Data Technologies To Improve Organisational Performance. Most Of The Articles' Contribution Reemphasised Technology Education And Training As A Means Of Digitising Business And Improving Effectiveness. Target Audience: The Target Readership Is Academic Researchers And Business Leaders Who Require Access To The Latest Developments In The Fields Of Economics, Information Management, Business, Education, Development Studies, Social Sciences And Technology.

"Risk, Information And Insurance",Henri Loubergé,,,,,"Orio Giarini The ""Geneva Association"" (International Association For The Study Of Risk And Insurance Economics) Was Founded In 1973. The Main Goal Was To Stimulate And Organize Objective Research In The Field Of Risk, Uncertainty, And Insurance, In A World In Which Such Issues Were Clearly Becoming Of Greater And Greater Relevance For All Economic Actors. This Was A Pioneer Ing Effort, Especially As Economic Theory And The Teaching Of Economics Were Still Anchored To The Key Notion Of General Equilibrium Under An Assumption Of Certainty. Thus, We Had To Start Our Work Almost From Scratch. One Of The First Initiatives Was To Bring Together In Geneva, In June Of 1973, All The Academics In Europe Already Involved In Risk And Insurance Economics. We Found Eight From Five Different Countries Who Never Had Met Before. This Seminar Chaired By Raymond Barre, The First President Of The Geneva Association, Was The First Of An Annual Series That Became Known As The Seminar Of ""The European Group Of Risk And Insurance Economists.""

Underdog Entrepreneurs,Horatio M. Morgan,,,,,"Entrepreneurship Is Challenging, Whatever Your Background, In The Current Science- And Technology-Driven Western World. However, Unlike Traditionally Dominant, Native-Born, White Male Entrepreneurs In Silicon Valley And Elsewhere, Those Who Face Greater Hurdles Blocking Their Path To Success Primarily Come From Marginalized And Minority Groups, Both Real And Self-Perceived—Including Immigrants, Refugees, Women, Blacks, Hispanics, And Asians. Despite Their Potential To Innovate And Add Value In The Global Marketplace, They Persistently Struggle, Or Fail, Because They Lack The Requisite Code-Breaking Skills. This Book Helps These Underdog Entrepreneurs Acquire Those Skills With Actionable Advice To Achieve And Sustain Success. It Proposes A Framework That Pinpoints What The Author Calls The Outsider Problem—That Is, Situations In Which Individuals Are Primarily Disadvantaged Because They Lack Access To Networks That Facilitate Superior Learning And Performance Outcomes. He Completes The Framework By Incorporating Personal Qualities And Strategies That Can Solve This Problem. Along The Way, Morgan Distills Insights And Evidence From Multiple Fields, Combined With A Fresh Look At The Familiar Stories Of Initially Marginalized Business Leaders, Such As Indra Nooyi, Jack Ma, Hilary Devey And Mike Lazaridis.

The Mental Representation Of Trait And Autobiographical Knowledge About The Self,"Thomas K. Srull', 'Robert S. Wyer",,,,,"If There Is One Topic On Which We All Are Experts, It Is Ourselves. Psychologists Depend Upon This Expertise, As Asking People Questions About Themselves Is An Important Means By Which They Gather The Data That Provide Much Of The Evidence For Psychological Theory. Personal Recollections Play An Important Role In Clinical Theorizing; People'S Thoughts, Feelings, And Beliefs Provide The Principal Data For Attitudinal Research; And Judgments Of One'S Traits And Descriptions Of One'S Goals And Motivations Are Essential For The Study Of Personality. Yet Despite Their Long Dependence On Self-Report Data, Psychologists Know Very Little About This Basic Resource And The Processes That Govern It. In Spite Of The Importance Of The Self As A Concept In Psychology, Virtually No Empirically-Tested Representational Models Of Self-Knowledge Can Be Found. Recently, However, Several Theoretical Accounts Of The Representation Of Self-Knowledge Have Been Proposed. These Models Have Been Concerned Primarily With The Factors Underlying A Particular Type Of Self Knowledge -- Our Trait Conceptions Of Ourselves. The Models All Share The Starting Assumption That The Source Of Our Knowledge Of The Traits That Describe Us Is Memory For Our Past Behavior. The Lead Article In This Volume Reviews The Available Models Of The Processes Underlying Trait Self-Descriptiveness Judgments. Although These Models Appear Quite Different In Their Basic Representational Assumptions, Exemplar And Abstraction Models Sometimes Are Difficult To Distinguish Experimentally. Presenting A Series Of Studies Using Several New Techniques Which The Authors Believe Are Effective For Assessing Whether People Recruit Specific Exemplars Or Abstract Trait Summaries When Making Trait Judgments About Themselves, They Conclude That Specific Behavioral Exemplars Play A Far Smaller Role In The Representation Of Trait Knowledge Than Previously Has Been Assumed. Finally, The Limitations Of Social Cognition Paradigms As Methods For Studying The Representation Of Long-Term Social Knowledge Are Discussed, And The Implications Of The Research For Both Existing And Future Social Psychological Research Are Explored.",Psychology Press,202.0,English,1993,"Self-Help , General",9780805813128

Social And Economic Management In The Competitive Society,Edgar Krau,,,,,"In Many Countries Of The World There Is A Growing Feeling Of Uneasiness About The Economic Situation And Its Related Social Consequences. Every Day The Newspapers Tell Us That The Recession Is Over, But We See Only That Scores Of Organizations Go Bankrupt, While Others Are Struggling Hard To Stay In Business; That Many People Have Lost Their Jobs, But Welfare Measures Are Being Reduced Or Abolished Altogether. By Now We Should Have Become Aware That Our Society Is Not Facing Temporary Market Difficulties, But A Much Deeper And Wider Crisis With Only One Root In Worldwide Economic Developments, While Other Roots Are Social And Psychological In Nature. These Factors Are Intertwined, And Therefore The Answer To The Crisis Cannot Merely Be An Economic Cost-Benefit Analysis Of Organizational Management. Sociocultural Factors Participate In The Economic Process Even At The Level Of Individual Organizations, And What Happens In Them Has Backlash Influences On The Entire Society. Therefore The Problem Is Not The Management Of The Individual Organization, But The Macroconception Of Management, Which In The Western World Of Today Separates The Economic Aspects From The Social Ones, And The Individual Organizations From Society. Social And Economic Management In The Competitive Society Begins By Analyzing The Management Models Of Today To Determine Which Characteristics Yield The Best Results On The Economic And Social Levels. The Second Step Is To Indicate The Necessary Changes Of Managerial Thinking And Acting, In Order To Boost Economic Results With Reasonable Profits While Minimizing Social Costs.

Entrepreneurship: Determinants And Policy In A European-Us Comparison,"David B. Audretsch', 'R. Thurik', 'Ingrid Verheul', 'Sander Wennekers",,,,,"Without A Clear And Organized View Of Where And How Entrepreneurship Manifests Itself, Policy Makers Have Been Left In Uncharted Waters Without An Analytical Compass. The Purpose Of This Book Is To Provide Such An Analytical Compass For Directing How Public Policy Can Shape And Promote Entrepreneurship. We Do This In Two Ways. The First Is To Provide A Framework For Policymakers And Scholars To Understand What Determines Entrepreneurship. The Second Is To Apply This Framework To A Series Of Cases, Or Country Studies. In Particular, This Book Seeks To Answer Three Questions About Entrepreneurship: What Has Happened Over Time? Why Did It Happen? And, What Has Been The Role Of Government Policy? The Cornerstone Of The Book Is The Proposed Eclectic Theory Of Entrepreneurship. The Goal Of The Eclectic Theory Is To Provide A Unified Framework For Understanding And Analyzing The Determinants Of Entrepreneurship. The Eclectic Theory Of Entrepreneurship Integrates The Different Strands From Relevant Fields Into A Unifying, Coherent Framework. At The Heart Of The Eclectic Theory Is The Integration Of Factors Shaping The Demand For Entrepreneurship On The One Hand, With Those Influencing The Supply Of Entrepreneurs On The Other Hand. The Key To Understanding The Role Of Public Policy Is Through Identifying Those Channels Shifting Either The Demand For Or The Supply Of Entrepreneurship By Policy Instruments. The Findings In This Book Show That, By Utilizing The Framework Provided By The Eclectic Theory Of Entrepreneurship, It Is Within The Grasp Of Policymakers To Identify The Determinants Of Entrepreneurship In A Particular Country Setting At A Particular Point In Time. This Will Be Essential In Formulating New Public Policies To Promote Entrepreneurship And, Ultimately, Economic Growth, Job Creation And International Competitiveness.",Springer Science & Business Media,248.0,English,2006-04-11,"Business &Amp, Economics , Entrepreneurship",9780306475566

"" Audretsch (2003, P. 5) States That ""Entrepreneurship Has Become The Engine Of Economic And Social Development Throughout The World. "" The Relation Between Entrepreneurship And Economic Growth Is Embedded In Several Strands Of The Economic Literature. A First Strand Of Literature Involves The General Understanding Of The Role Of Entrepreneurship In The Modern Economy. Seminal Contributions Were Made By Schumpeter (1934), Knight (1921) And Kirzner (1973). These Economists Stress Different Aspects Of The Role Of The Entrepreneur.

Broken Markets,Kevin Mellyn,,,,,"""I Would Sleep Better If I Knew That Bernanke, Geithner, Bachus, Sen. Tim Johnson, Obama And Romney All Kept Dog-Eared Copies Of Kevin Mellyn'S Broken Markets On Their Nightstands. . . . Mellyn'S Work Is A Fascinating, Important, And Eminently Good Read And Should Inform The Debate On Overhauling The U.S. And Global Financial Regulatory Systems And Sustainable Macro Fiscal And Monetary Policy."" --Eric Grover, In His Review Of Broken Markets In The American Banker Broken Markets Allows The Intelligent Non-Specialist To Understand And Navigate The Ongoing Worldwide Aftermath Of The 2008 Financial Market Meltdown. The Key Theme Of The Book Is How The Leading Financial Institutions And The Political Leadership Of The U.S. And European Union Have Failed Us And Set The Stage For Continued Market Turmoil. It Explains What This Means For Investors, Borrowers, Society In General, And The Financial-Services Industry. Former Banker Kevin Mellyn Focuses On Providing Readers With Clear And Simple Explanations Of The Forces At Work And The Potential Consequences For Their Future Prosperity. As This Book Makes Clear, What’S Coming Is A World In Which High Structural Unemployment And Flat Or Declining Real Income Is Likely—Not To Mention A Diminished Retirement Financial Safety Net. The Book Therefore Provides Actionable Information For Protecting Wealth And Making Prudent Investment Decisions In An Economy That Is Nothing Like The One That Has Sustained Us For Decades. As A Forward-Looking Narrative About Rapidly Changing Events And Volatile Markets And Politics, Broken Markets Will Provide No Single Prediction About The Future But Rather Describe Alternative Scenarios And Provide The Reader With Signposts To Watch Out For In Deciding Which Reality Is Actually Unfolding. Unlike Most Books Written By Journalists On Global Finance, The Scenarios And Signposts Described Will Be Largely Based On The Lessons Of Financial And Political History Rather Than Breaking News. This Book: Tells You In Plain Language How Today’S Financial System Threatens Your Livelihood And Wealth Tells You Why And How Governments Worldwide, With Some Notable Exceptions, Are Taking Actions Likely To Make Things Worse Instead Of Better Explains How The Leading Financial Institutions Lost Their Way During The Bubble Years And How They Can Find The Path Back To Prosperity And Value To Society Tells You What Life Will Be Like In A “Post-Finance” Economy And How You Can Protect Your Wealth",Apress,181.0,English,2012-08-08,"Business &Amp, Economics , Finance , General",9781430242222

The Road To Freedom,Peter Allman,,,,,"We Are Not Human Beings That Have Spiritual Experiences. We Are Truly Spiritual Beings That Are Currently Having A Human Experience.

The Ego Is The Main Reason The Divine Union Does Not Occur. The Ego Is A Way Of Thinking. It Is A Mind - A Mindset - That Is Built On The Absence Of The Divine And Creates A False Sense Of Self. The Ego Mind Sees The World In Terms Of ""I Want This"" Or ""I Don'T Want This."" The Three Letters Of Ego Could Stand For ""Edging God Out.""

The Business Of Economics,"John Anderson Kay', 'Professor Of Economics John Kay",,,,,"Medicine And Business Management Share Certain Similarities, Writes John Kay. For Centuries, The Theories Behind Medical Practice Were Mostly Nonsense. Doctors Simply Applied Fashionable Nostrums, Bleeding One Patient, Starving Another, And Sometimes The Patient Got Better, Sometimes Not. The Prestige Of A Doctor Rested More On The Social Rank Of His Patients And The Confidence Of His Assertions Than On The Evidence Of His Cures. Much The Same Can Be Said Of Present-Day Management Gurus. But There Is One Difference Between Medicine And Management, Kay Adds. In The Last 100 Years, Medicine Has Been Transformed By Science. Management Has Not. In The Business Of Economics, Kay Argues That It Is Economics That Can Provide The Science That Management Presently Lacks, That Economics Is The Natural Backbone Of Business Management. In The Many Insightful And Lively Pieces Collected Here, Kay Looks At The Application Of Economics To The Central Strategic Issues Facing Firms--Their Choice Of Activities And Markets. He Is Particularly Interested In Microeconomics, The Study Of Markets, Industries, And Firms, And Is On The Other Hand Highly Critical Of Macroeconomics, Economic Modeling, And Economic Forecasting (Which He Says Is Inevitably Wrong). He Is Especially Illuminating On The Recently Developed Resource-Based Theory Of Strategy, Which Attempts To Explain The Success Or Failure Of A Firm In Terms Of Its ""Distinctive Capabilities"" (The Factors Which Differentiate Them From Others In The Same Market And Which Cannot Be Easily Reproduced By Competitors Even When Recognized.) For Instance, Bmw'S Highly Skilled Work Force, Due To Germany'S High Level Of General Education, Is Hard To Reproduce By Competitors In Other Countries. Kay Shows How Bmw Exploited Its Highly Skilled Labor Force (Opposed To Low-Wage Foreign Workers Or Robots Found In Many Other Auto Plants) To Get A Large Share Of The Market For Up-Scale, High-Performance Cars. Among The Many Other Topics Discussed In This Idea-Rich Book Are Saatchi & Saatchi'S Dismal Attempt To Globalize In The 1980S, Honda'S Great Success Selling Low-End Motorcycles In The U.S., The Fare Of The Eurotunnel, And The Reason Why Race-Car Driver Nigel Mansell Makes Seventy-Five Times As Much Money A Year As Britain'S Prime Minister, John Major. Described In Business Age As The ""Most Important Business Analyst In Britain Bar None,"" John Kay Is Renowned For His Incisive, Entertaining, And Controversial Columns In The Financial Times Of London. In Addition, He Is A Regular Commentator On Radio And Tv, And Is In Much Demand As A Speaker And Consultant. In The Business Of Economics, He Shares His Thoughts On A Wide Range Of Issues Facing Businesses Today.

The Inspector-General (Annotated With Biography),Nikolai Gogol,,,,,"The Government Inspector, Also Known As The Inspector General , Is A Satirical Play By The Russophone Ukrainian Playwright And Novelist Nikolai Gogol. Originally Published In 1836, The Play Was Revised For An 1842 Edition. Based Upon An Anecdote Allegedly Recounted To Gogol By Pushkin, The Play Is A Comedy Of Errors, Satirizing Human Greed, Stupidity, And The Extensive Political Corruption Of Imperial Russia. According To D. S. Mirsky, The Play ""Is Not Only Supreme In Character And Dialogue In It Is One Of The Few Russian Plays Constructed With Unerring Art From Beginning To End. The Great Originality Of Its Plan Consisted In The Absence Of All Love Interest And Of Sympathetic Characters. The Latter Feature Was Deeply Resented By Gogol'S Enemies, And As A Satire The Play Gained Immensely From It. There Is Not A Wrong Word Or Intonation From Beginning To End, And The Comic Tension Is Of A Quality That Even Gogol Did Not Always Have At His Beck And Call. The Dream-Like Scenes Of The Play, Often Mirroring Each Other, Whirl In The Endless Vertigo Of Self-Deception Around The Main Character, Khlestakov, Who Personifies Irresponsibility, Light-Mindedness, Absence Of Measure. ""He Is Full Of Meaningless Movement And Meaningless Fermentation Incarnate, On A Foundation Of Placidly Ambitious Inferiority"" (D.S. Mirsky). The Publication Of The Play Led To A Great Outcry In The Reactionary Press.

Handbook Of Economic Psychology,"W.F. Van Raaij', 'G.M. Van Veldhoven', 'K.E. Wärneryd",,,,,"The Idea To Publish A Handbook Of Economic Psychology Came Up As A Natural Consequence Of A Discussion Concerning Appropriate Reading Material For Courses In Economic Psychology. The Discussion Took Place A Few Years Ago In The Department Of Economic Psychology At Tilburg University, The Netherlands. It Was Noted That There Was A Surprising Lack Of Collections Of Pertinent Readings, To Say Nothing About The Lack Of Textbooks In The English Language. So The Present Editors, Who Had Been Involved In The Discussion, Decided To Start Working On A Handbook. The Situation Has Changed Quite A Lot Since Then. There Are Now A Number Of Books, Internationally Available In The English Language, In Economic Psy Chology Or Behavioral Economics. The Interest In This Field Of Study Is Expanding Quite Impressively. The Journal Of Economic Psychology Is Now (1988) In Its Ninth Volume And Many Other Journals Are Publishing Articles In The Field. The Application Of Psychological Theories And Methods To Economic Prob Lems Or The Study Of Economic Experiences And Behavior Is Variously Referred To As Economic Psychology Or Behavioral Economics. While In Principle We Do Not Want To Overdo The Differences Between The Two, We Have A Feeling That Economic Psychology Has A Slightly Stronger Flavor Of Psychology Than Behavioral Economics Which In Its Turn Seems To Be Closer To Economics.

Understanding Economic Behaviour,"Klaus Günter Grunert', 'Folke Ölander",,,,,"May Be Related To Another Basic Assumption In Economic Psychology: That The Human Capacity To Process Information From The Environment Is Limited, And That The Kind Of Optimal Use Of That Information Postulated In Many Economic Theories Is Therefore Not Possible. The Research Methods Used Are Mainly Geared Towards Empirical Research, And There Mostly Towards Survey Research And Experimentation. Experimentation Involves Most Often Simulated Behaviour In A Laboratory, Which Allows The Experimental Manipulation Of Possible Causes Of Behaviour Which Would Not Be Possible In Real Life. Survey Research Is The Most Widely Used Instrument For Investigating Real-World Behaviour, With All Its Caveats About Establishing Causal Explanations. Several Introductory Books (E. G. , Fumham & Lewis, 1986; Lea, Tarpy, & Webley, 1987; Van Raaij, Van Veldhoven, & Wlimeryd, 1988) And Articles (E. G. , Van Raaij, 1979; Wiswede, 1988) Have Appeared Recently, Which Try To Give An Overview Of The Field Of Economic Psychology, And Which, In Varying Degrees, Demonstrate The Three Foundations Of Economic Psychology Just Mentioned.

Soul Of The New Consumer,David Lewis Darren Bridger,,,,,"The New Consumer'S Revolution: * Why Buzz Beats Hype * Why Cheap Is Chic * Why Brands Must Be Authentic * Why Segmentation Is Dead * Why Advertising Must Reinvent Itself * Why New Consumers Loathe 'Doing The Shopping' * Why Individuals' Tastespace Will Triumph In The Marketplace New Consumers Are Revolutionizing The World Of Business, Our Culture And Social Expectations. No Longer Confined By Gender, Age, Ethnicity Or Income, They Are Breaking Down Barriers, Shattering Stereotypes And Redefining The Very Meaning Of Consumerism And The Marketplace. From Traditional To Online Retailing, From Tracking Coolhunters To Exploring Tastepace, The Soul Of The New Consumer Unearths The Very Essence Of New Consumer'S Behavior - Their Drive For Authenticity - And Goes Far Beyond The Simple Concepts Of How We Shop Or What We Buy To Answer The Most Important Question Of All: Why. Every Facet Of The New Economy, From Buzz Marketing And New Retailing Technologies To Internet Shopping, Has Dramatically Altered Not Only How We Buy But What We Buy And Why. In An Era Of 'Cheap Is Chic', Wealthy Shoppers Haggle To Win Even The Smallest Discounts ; Gray Consumers Buy More Rap And Techno Music Than Anyone Else And Are The Fastest Growing Group Of Internet Users ; And The Web And The Power Of Micro-Marketing Have Revolutionized Forever The Means Of Wooing New Customers. New Consumers Are Taking Over The World And Redefining The Very Meaning Of Consumerism And The Marketplace. As Likely To Be Affluent Over-Fifties As Ambitious Under-Thirties, New Consumers Defy Traditional Marketing Concepts And Segmentation By Age, Gender Or Income. In Pursuit Of The Authentic Experience, New Consumers Come Together In Their Defining Drive For All Things 'Real', In Everything From Food To Fashion, Foreign Holidays To Furniture, Technology To Spirituality. Their Attention And Interest Have Shifted From Commodity To Authenticity. In An Affluent World Now Saturated With Affordable Products There Are Three New Scarcities - Time, Attention And Trust. This Major Book Shows How These Can Be Won By 'Giving The Soul Control' Rather Than Putting Customers On The 'Customer Is King' Pedestal. Over The Past Decade, Lewis And Bridger Have Been At The Forefront Of Researching The New Consumers - Studying Their Lifestyles, Observing Behavior And Watching The Steady Rise In Their Numbers, Influence And Economic Power. Here, For The First Time And With Example From Starbucks To Dyson, They Report The Results Of Their Work, Including Amex'S Use Of Computer Technology To Create Intimate Protraits Of Individuals - What The Author'S Call 'Tastepace'.",,,English,2011,"Business &Amp, Economics , Consumer Behavior",9781473652538

The Stories Are A Mix Of Fact And Fiction.

Some Stories, Or Parts Of Stories, Are Based On Reports Of Fellow Soldiers Or On Impressions Of What Likely Occurred - - The Product Of Fact And The Author'S Imagination.

General Principles And Etiology,James Wilson,,,,,"In Less Than 40 Years Teratology Has Grown From A Little Known Discipline Concerned With Studies On The Effects Of A Few Physical And Chemical Stresses On Developing Fish, Amphibians, And Birds, To A Discipline Embracing A Vast Accumulation Of Literature On Experimental Studies In Many Animal Forms And The Results Of Intensive Scrutiny Of Human Development Under Varied Conditions, As Well. Emphasis Has Shifted From Preoccupation With Descrip Tions Of Anatomical Defects To Concern About Subtle And Interacting Causative Factors, To Searches For The Early Reactions To These At The Cellular And Subcellu Lar Levels, And To Identification Of Abnormality In The Chemical, The Functional, And The Ultrastructural Realms. These Changes In Orientation Have Quite Naturally Made Necessary The Recruitment Of Concepts, Methods, And Expertise From Other Disciplines. Hence The Foundations Of Teratology, Which Once Were Largely Morphological, Have Extended Into Genetics, Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, Reproductive Physiology, Epidemiology, And Several Aspects Of Veteri Nary And Clinical Medicine.

Video Games,Arthur Asa Berger,,,,,"From Their Inception, Video Games Quickly Became A Major New Arena Of Popular Entertainment. Beginning With Very Primitive Games, They Quickly Evolved Into Interactive Animated Works, Many Of Which Now Approach Film In Terms Of Their Visual Excitement. But There Are Important Differences, As Arthur Asa Berger Makes Clear In This Important New Work. Films Are Purely To Be Viewed, But Video Involves The Player, Moving From Empathy To Immersion, From Being Spectators To Being Actively Involved In Texts. Berger, A Renowned Scholar Of Popular Culture, Explores The Cultural Significance Of The Expanding Popularity And Sophistication Of Video Games And Considers The Biological And Psychoanalytic Aspects Of This Phenomenon. Berger Begins By Tracing The Evolution Of Video Games From Simple Games Like Pong To New, Powerfully Involving And Complex Ones Like Myst And Half-Life. He Notes How This Evolution Has Built The Video Industry, Which Includes The Hardware (Game-Playing Consoles) And The Software (The Games Themselves), To Revenues Comparable To The American Film Industry. Building On This Comparison, Berger Focuses On Action-Adventure Games Which, Like Film And Fiction, Tell Stories But Which Also Involve Culturally Important Departures In The Conventions Of Narrative. After Defining A Set Of Bipolar Oppositions Between Print And Electronic Narratives, Berger Considers The Question Of Whether Video Games Are Truly Interactive Or Only Superficially So, And Whether They Have The Potential To Replace Print Narratives In The Culture At Large. A Unique Dimension Of The Book Is Its Bio-Psycho-Social Analysis Of The Video Game Phenomenon. Berger Considers The Impact Of These Games On Their Players, From Physical Changes (Everything From Neurological Problems To Obesity) To Psychological Consequences, With Reference To Violence And Sexual Attitudes. He Takes These Questions Further By Examining Three Enormously Popular Games-Myst/Riven, Tomb Raider, And Half-Life-For Their Attitudes Toward Power, Gender, Violence, And Guilt. In His Conclusion, Berger Concentrates On The Role Of Violence In Video Games And Whether They Generate A Sense Of Alienation In Certain Addicted Players Who Become Estranged From Family And Friends. Accessibly Written And Broad-Ranging In Approach, Video Games Offers A Way To Interpret A Major Popular Phenomenon. Arthur Asa Berger Is Professor Of Broadcast And Electronic Communication Arts At San Francisco State University, Where He Has Taught Since 1965. He Is The Author Of More Than One Hundred Articles And Forty Books On Media, Popular Culture, Humor, And Everyday Life.",Transaction Publishers,119.0,English,2002,"Games &Amp, Activities , Video &Amp, Electronic",9781412841047

Benjamin T. Duranske, Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman Llp, Us 'Videogaming Is Serious Business. But The Legal And Theoretical Implications Of Online And Virtual Environments Are Little Understood. Professor Graber And Ms. Burri-Nenova Have Done A Masterful Job Of Bringing Together Several Insightful Articles That Inform Us About The Business, Legal And Sociological Implications Of Digital Gaming.

Digital Game Environments Are Of Increasing Economic, Social And Cultural Value.

That Tradition Has Tended To Atrophy In The Last Decade, Largely Because Of An Enormous Expansion Of The Domain Of Neoc1Assical Economics. The Expansion Has Fed On Two Sdentific Developments: First, Human Capital Theory; Second, Contract Theory. Both Developments Have Taken Phenomena Critical To The Operation Of The Economy But Previously Understood In Terms Of Categories Separate And Distinct From Those With Which Economists Generally Work And Sought To Apply The Same Analytical Techniques That We Use To Understand Other Economic Problems. Human Capital Theory Has Applied Conventional Techniques To Questions Of Labor Supply. It Began This Endeavor With The Supply Of Trained Labor And Then Expanded To A General Theory Of Labor Supply By Broadening The Analysis To The Allocation Of Time Over The Individual'S Life, The Interdependendes Of Supply Decisions Within The Family, And Finally To The Formation Of The Family Itself. Similarly, Contract Theory Has Moved From A Theory That Explains The Existence Of C10Sed Economic Institutions To A Theory Of Their Formation And Internaioperation. The Hallmark Of Both Of These Developments Is The Extension And Applica Tion Of Analytical Techniques Based On Purposive Maximization Under Con Traints And The Interaction Of Individual Decision Makers Through A Com Petitive Market Or Its Analogue.",Springer Science & Business Media,350.0,English,2013-11-11,"Business &Amp, Economics , Careers , General",9781489935366

The Korean Wave In A Post-Pandemic World,"Geon-Cheol Shin', 'Mark Whitaker",,,,,"This Book Presents An Analysis Of How The Economic Korean Miracle Spread Into The Cultural “Korean Wave” (Hallyu). First Only In Asian Countries And Then Around The World, The Rising Popularity Of The Korean Wave Continued Within The Pandemic—Despite Or Even Because Of Policies Of Digital Lockdowns.

Thus, The Authors Examine How The Korean Wave Coped Actively With A Pronounced Digital Shift By Default In All Aspects Of Media Including Production, Distribution, And Consumption. In Turn, They Examine How The Greater Digital Shift In The World’S Culture And Economy Influenced The Korean Wave’S Entertainment Performances, Tv Dramas, And Cosmetics—Among Other Areas.

Poetry And British Nationalisms In The Bardic Eighteenth Century,Jeff Strabone,,,,,"This Book Offers A Radical New Theory Of The Role Of Poetry In The Rise Of Cultural Nationalism. With Equal Attention To England, Scotland, And Wales, The Book Takes An Archipelagic Approach To The Study Of Poetics, Print Media, And Medievalism In The Rise Of British Romanticism. It Tells The Story Of How Poets And Antiquarian Editors In The British Nations Rediscovered Forgotten Archaic Poetic Texts And Repurposed Them As The Foundation Of A New Concept Of The Nation, Now Imagined As A Primarily Cultural Formation. It Also Draws On Legal And Ecclesiastical History In Drawing A Sharp Contrast Between Early Modern And Romantic Antiquarianisms.

Nations Of Nothing But Poetry,Matthew Hart,,,,,"Modernism Is Typically Associated With Novelty And Urbanity. So What Happens When Poets Identify Small Communities And Local Languages With The Spirit Of Transnational Modernity? Are Vernacular Poetries Inherently Provincial Or Implicitly Xenophobic? How Did Modernist Poets Use Vernacular Language To Re-Imagine The Relations Between People, Their Languages, And The Communities In Which They Live? Nations Of Nothing But Poetry Answers These Questions Through Case Studies Of British, Caribbean, And American Poetries From The 1920S Through The 1990S. With A Combination Of Fresh Insights And Attentive Close Readings, Matthew Hart Presents A New Theory Of A ""Synthetic Vernacular""-Writing That Explores The Aesthetic And Ideological Tensions Within Modernism'S Dual Commitments To The Local And The Global. The Result Is An Invigorating Contribution To The Field Of Transnational Modernist Studies. Chapters Focus On A Mixture Of Canonical And Non-Canonical Writers, Combining New Literary Histories--Such As The Story Of How Melvin B. Tolson, While A Resident Of Oklahoma, Was Appointed Poet Laureate Of Liberia--With Analyses Of Poems By Gertrude Stein, W. H. Auden, Ezra Pound, And T. S. Eliot. More Broadly, The Book Reveals How The Language Of Modernist Poetry Was Shaped By The Incompletely Globalized Nature Of A World In Which The Nation-State Continued To Be A Primary Mediator Of Cultural And Political Identity, Even As Its Authority Was Challenged As Never Before. Through Deft Juxtaposition, Hart Develops A New Interpretation Of Modernist Poetry In English-One That Disrupts The Critical Opposition Between Nationalism And The Transnational, Paving The Way For A Political History Of Modernist Cosmopolitanism.",Oxford University Press,256.0,English,2010-04-22,"Poetry , European , None, Irish, Scottish, Welsh",9780199741618

Seamus Heaney’S Regions,Richard Rankin Russell,,,,,"Regional Voices From England, Ireland, And Scotland Inspired Seamus Heaney, The 1995 Nobel Prize-Winner, To Become A Poet, And His Home Region Of Northern Ireland Provided The Subject Matter For Much Of His Poetry. In His Work, Heaney Explored, Recorded, And Preserved Both The Disappearing Agrarian Life Of His Origins And The Dramatic Rise Of Sectarianism And The Subsequent Outbreak Of The Northern Irish “Troubles” Beginning In The Late 1960S. At The Same Time, Heaney Consistently Imagined A New Region Of Northern Ireland Where The Conflicts That Have Long Beset It And, By Extension, The Relationship Between Ireland And The United Kingdom Might Be Synthesized And Resolved. Finally, There Is A Third Region Heaney Committed Himself To Explore And Map—The Spirit Region, That World Beyond Our Ken. In Seamus Heaney’S Regions, Richard Rankin Russell Argues That Heaney’S Regions—The First, Geographic, Historical, Political, Cultural, Linguistic; The Second, A Future Where Peace, Even Reconciliation, Might One Day Flourish; The Third, The Life Beyond This One—Offer The Best Entrance Into And A Unified Understanding Of Heaney’S Body Of Work In Poetry, Prose, Translations, And Drama. As Russell Shows, Heaney Believed In The Power Of Ideas—And The Texts Representing Them—To Begin Resolving Historical Divisions. For Russell, Heaney’S Regionalist Poetry Contains A “Hegelian Synthesis” View Of History That Imagines Potential Resolutions To The Conflicts That Have Plagued Ireland And Northern Ireland For Centuries. Drawing On Extensive Archival And Primary Material By The Poet, Seamus Heaney’S Regions Examines Heaney’S Work From Before His First Published Poetry Volume, Death Of A Naturalist In 1966, To His Most Recent Volume, The Elegiac Human Chain In 2010, To Provide The Most Comprehensive Treatment Of The Poet’S Work To Date.",University Of Notre Dame Pess,512.0,English,2014-06-30,"Poetry , European , None, Irish, Scottish, Welsh",9780268091811

Charles Peirce And Modern Science,T. L. Short,,,,,"In This Book, T. L. Short Places The Notorious Difficulties Of Peirce'S Important Writings In A More Productive Light, Arguing That He Wrote Philosophy As A Scientist, By Framing Conjectures Intended To Be Refined Or Superseded In The Inquiries They Initiate. He Argues Also That Peirce Held That The Methods And Metaphysics Of Modern Science Are Amended As Inquiry Progresses, Making Metaphysics A Branch Of Empirical Knowledge. Additionally, Short Shows That Peirce'S Scientific Work Expanded Empiricism On Empirical Grounds, Grounding His Phenomenology And Subverting The Fact/Value Dichotomy, And That He Understood Statistical Explanations In Nineteenth-Century Science As Reintroducing The Idea Of Final Causation, Now Made Empirical. Those Innovations Underlie Peirce'S Late Ideas Of A Normative Science And Of Philosophy As A Branch Of Science. Short'S Rich And Original Study Shows Us How To Read Peirce'S Writings And Why They Are Worth Reading.",Cambridge University Press,293.0,English,2022-09-15,"Philosophy , History &Amp, Surveys , Modern",9781009223492

Modern Logic — A Survey,E. Agazzi,,,,,"Logic Has Attained In Our Century A Development Incomparably Greater Than In Any Past Age Of Its Long History, And This Has Led To Such An Enrichment And Proliferation Of Its Aspects, That The Problem Of Some Kind Of Unified Recom Prehension Of This Discipline Seems Nowadays Unavoidable. This Splitting Into Several Subdomains Is The Natural Consequence Of The Fact That Logic Has Intended To Adopt In Our Century The Status Of A Science. This Always Implies That The General Optics, Under Which A Certain Set Of Problems Used To Be Con Sidered, Breaks Into A Lot Of Specialized Sectors Of Inquiry, Each Of Them Being Characterized By The Introduction Of Specific Viewpoints And Of Technical Tools Of Its Own. The First Impression, That Often Accompanies The Creation Of One Of Such Specialized Branches In A Discipline, Is That One Has Succeeded In Isolating The 'Scientific Core' Of It, By Restricting The Somehow Vague And Redundant Generality Of Its Original 'Philosophical' Configuration. But, After A While, It Appears That Some Of The Discarded Aspects Are Indeed Important And A New Specialized Domain Of Investigation Is Created To Explore Them. By Following This Procedure, One Finally Finds Himself Confronted With Such A Variety Of Independent Fields Of Research, That One Wonders Whether The Fact Of Labelling Them Under A Common Denomination Be Nothing But The Contingent Effect Of A Pure Historical Tradition.",Springer Science & Business Media,483.0,English,2012-12-06,"Philosophy , History &Amp, Surveys , Modern",9789400990562

Hegel'S Logic And Metaphysics,Jacob Mcnulty,,,,,"Kant Said That Logic Had Not Had To Take A Single Step Forward Since Aristotle, But German Idealists In The Following Generation Made Concerted Efforts To Re-Think The Logical Foundations Of Philosophy. In This Book, Jacob Mcnulty Offers A New Interpretation Of Hegel'S Logic, The Key Work Of His Philosophical System. Mcnulty Shows That Hegel Is Responding To A Perennial Problem In The History And Philosophy Of Logic: The Logocentric Predicament. In Hegel, We Find An Answer To A Question So Basic That It Cannot Be Posed Without Risking Incoherence: What Is The Justification For Logic? How Can One Justify Logic Without Already Relying Upon It? The Answer Takes The Form Of Re-Thinking The Role Of Metaphysics In Philosophy, So That Logic Assumes A New Position As Derivative Rather Than Primary.

Using Examples From Japan, Korea, Indonesia And Chinese Cultures In Mainland China, Hong Kong And Taiwan, The Contributors Explore The Different Cultural Rules For Creating And Sharing Humour. Humour Can Be A Powerful Lubricant When Correctly Interpreted; Mis-Interpreted, It Is Likely To Cause Considerable Setbacks.

Costello'S Son, A Physics Professor, Admires Her Literary Achievements, But Dreads His Mother’S Lecturing On Animal Rights At The College Where He Teaches. His Colleagues Resist Her Argument That Human Reason Is Overrated And That The Inability To Reason Does Not Diminish The Value Of Life; His Wife Denounces His Mother’S Vegetarianism As A Form Of Moral Superiority. At The Dinner That Follows Her First Lecture, The Guests Confront Costello With A Range Of Sympathetic And Skeptical Reactions To Issues Of Animal Rights, Touching On Broad Philosophical, Anthropological, And Religious Perspectives. Painfully For Her Son, Elizabeth Costello Seems Offensive And Flaky, But—Dare He Admit It?—Strangely On Target. In This Landmark Book, Nobel Prize–Winning Writer J. M. Coetzee Uses Fiction To Present A Powerfully Moving Discussion Of Animal Rights In All Their Complexity. He Draws Us Into Elizabeth Costello’S Own Sense Of Mortality, Her Compassion For Animals, And Her Alienation From Humans, Even From Her Own Family.

As In The Story Of Elizabeth Costello, The Tanner Lecture Is Followed By Responses Treating The Reader To A Variety Of Perspectives, Delivered By Leading Thinkers In Different Fields.

Reconstructing Illness,Anne Hunsaker Hawkins,,,,,"Serious Illness And Mortality, Those Most Universal, Unavoidable, And Frightening Of Human Experiences, Are The Focus Of This Pioneering Study Which Has Been Hailed As A Telling And Provocative Commentary On Our Times. As Modern Medicine Has Become More Scientific And Dispassionate, A New Literary Genre Has Emerged: Pathography, The Personal Narrative Concerning Illness, Treatment, And Sometimes Death. Hawkins'S Sensitive Reading Of Numerous Pathographies Highlights The Assumptions, Attitudes, And Myths That People Bring To The Medical Encounter. One Factor Emerges Again And Again In These Case Studies: The Tendency In Contemporary Medical Practice To Focus Primarily Not On The Needs Of The Individual Who Is Sick But On The Condition That We Call Disease. Pathography Allows The Individual Person A Voice-One That Asserts The Importance Of The Experiential Side Of Illness, And Thus Restores The Feeling, Thinking, Experiencing Human Being To The Center Of The Medical Enterprise. Recommended For Medical Practitioners, The Clergy, Caregivers, Students Of Popular Culture, And The General Reader, Reconstructing Illness Demonstrates That Only When We Hear Both The Doctor'S And The Patient'S Voice Will We Have A Medicine That Is Truly Human.",Purdue University Press,316.0,English,1999,"Biography &Amp, Autobiography , Medical (Incl.

Reimagining Business History Prods Practitioners To Take New Approaches To Entrepreneurial Intentions, Company Scale, Corporate Strategies, Local Infrastructure, Employee Well-Being, Use Of Resources, And Long-Term Environmental Consequences. During The Past Half Century, The History Of American Business Became An Unusually Active And Rewarding Field Of Scholarship, Partly Because Of The Primacy Of Postwar American Capital, At Home And Abroad, And The Rise Of A Consumer Culture But Also Because Of The Theoretical Originality Of Alfred D. Chandler. In A Field Long Given Over To Banal Company Histories And Biographies Of Tycoons, Chandler Took The Subject Seriously Enough To Ask About The Large Patterns And Causes Of Corporate Success. Chandler And His Students Found The Richest Material For Theorizing About The Course Of Business History In Large Companies And Their Institutional Structures And Cultures. Meantime, Scranton And Others Found Smaller Firms, Those Specializing In Batch Work As Opposed To Mass-Produced Goods, Far Closer To The Norm And More Telling.

Can We Live Together?,"Alain Touraine', 'David Macey",,,,,"In This Book, A Leading French Social Thinker Grapples With The Gap Between The Tendency Toward Globalization Of Economic Relations And Mass Culture And The Increasingly Sectarian Nature Of Our Social Identities As Members Of Ethnic, Religious, Or National Groups. Though At First Glance, It Might Seem As If The Answer To The Question Can We Live Together? Is That We Already Do Live TogetherWatching The Same Television Programs, Buying The Same Clothes, And Even Using The Same Language To Communicate From One Country To AnotherThe Author Argues That In Important Ways, We Are Farther Than Ever From Belonging To The Same Society Or The Same Culture. Our Small Societies Are Not Gradually Merging Into One Vast Global Society; Instead, The Simultaneously Political, Territorial, And Cultural Entities That We Once Called Societies Or Countries Are Breaking Up Before Our Eyes In The Wake Of Ethnic, Political, And Religious Conflict. The Result Is That We Live Together Only To The Extent That We Make The Same Gestures And Use The Same ObjectsWe Do Not Communicate With One Another In A Meaningful Way Or Govern Ourselves Together. What Power Can Now Reconcile A Transnational Economy With The Disturbing Reality Of Introverted Communities? The Author Argues Against The Idea That All We Can Do Is Agree On Some Social Rules Of Mutual Tolerance And Respect For Personal Freedom, And Forgo The Attempt To Forge Deeper Bonds. He Argues Instead That We Can Use A Focus On The Personal Life-ProjectThe Construction Of An Active Self Or SubjectUltimately To Form Meaningful Social And Political Institutions. The Book Concludes By Exploring How Social Institutions Might Be Retooled To Safeguard The Development Of The Personal Subject And Communication Between Subjects, And By Sketching Out What These New Social Institutions Might Look Like In Terms Of Social Relations, Politics, And Education.",Stanford University Press,344.0,English,2000,"Self-Help , Personal Growth , Happiness",9780804740432
Wellbeing And Aspirational Culture,Kevin Moore,,,,,"This Book Addresses The Paradox That, Despite Quantifiable Advances, People Often Struggle To Experience Positive Wellbeing. Kevin Moore Argues That Two Key Insights Can Help Resolve This Paradox: First, That We Live In An ‘Aspirational Culture’ That Has Its Roots In The Agrarian Revolution And Now Demands Constant Economic Growth, Individual Ambition, And Self-Improvement While Promoting Change And Uncertainty; And Second, That We Are Persons, And Persons Are Created When Cultures Interact With Our Biology. Accordingly, Our Wellbeing Depends On How Personhood Develops Through That Interaction. Bringing Together Wellbeing And Personhood Research From Multiple Disciplines, Moore Explains How Aspirational Cultures Are Detrimental To Wellbeing Because They Consistently Undermine And Disrupt The Ordinary Tasks Of Life That Are Essential To Sustaining Our Personhood And Wellbeing. He Concludes That If We Are Serious About Improving Wellbeing, We Have To Create A Culture Not Based On Aspiration But Which, Instead, Focuses On Supporting Persons And Personhood.",Springer,243.0,English,2019-04-11,"Self-Help , Personal Growth , Happiness",9783030156435

Works Of Game,John Sharp,,,,,"An Exploration Of The Relationship Between Games And Art That Examines The Ways That Both Gamemakers And Artists Create Game-Based Artworks. Games And Art Have Intersected At Least Since The Early Twentieth Century, As Can Be Seen In The Surrealists' Use Of Exquisite Corpse And Other Games, Duchamp'S Obsession With Chess, And Fluxus Event Scores And Boxes—To Name Just A Few Examples. Over The Past Fifteen Years, The Synthesis Of Art And Games Has Clouded For Both Artists And Gamemakers. Contemporary Art Has Drawn On The Tool Set Of Videogames, But Has Not Considered Them A Cultural Form With Its Own Conceptual, Formal, And Experiential Affordances. For Their Part, Game Developers And Players Focus On The Innate Properties Of Games And The Experiences They Provide, Giving Little Attention To What It Means To Create And Evaluate Fine Art. In Works Of Game, John Sharp Bridges This Gap, Offering A Formal Aesthetics Of Games That Encompasses The Commonalities And The Differences Between Games And Art. Sharp Describes Three Communities Of Practice And Offers Case Studies For Each. “Game Art,” Which Includes Such Artists As Julian Oliver, Cory Arcangel, And Jodi (Joan Heemskerk And Dirk Paesmans) Treats Videogames As A Form Of Popular Culture From Which Can Be Borrowed Subject Matter, Tools, And Processes. “Artgames,” Created By Gamemakers Including Jason Rohrer, Brenda Romero, And Jonathan Blow, Explore Territory Usually Occupied By Poetry, Painting, Literature, Or Film. Finally, “Artists' Games”—With Artists Including Blast Theory, Mary Flanagan, And The Collaboration Of Nathalie Pozzi And Eric Zimmerman—Represents A More Synthetic Conception Of Games As An Artistic Medium. The Work Of These Gamemakers, Sharp Suggests, Shows That It Is Possible To Create Game-Based Artworks That Satisfy The Aesthetic And Critical Values Of Both The Contemporary Art And Game Communities.",Mit Press,157.0,English,2015-03-06,"Art , Video Game Art",9780262029070

Video Games Offer Opportunities To Navigate Both Historical And Fictional Conflicts, Traverse Landscapes Devastated By Climate Change Or Nuclear Holocaust, And Manage The Limited Resources Of Individuals Or Even Whole Civilizations On Earth And Beyond. They Offer Players A Dizzying Array Of Dystopian Scenarios In Which To Build And Invent, Cooperate With Others (Through Other Players, Npcs, Or Ai) To Survive Another Day.

Art And Play: How Many Forms Does This Relationship Take? Duchamp Used To Say That Art Was A Game And That Games Were Art. When Video Games Joined The Dance Of The Muses This Relationship Was Further Enriched. Video Games Are An Art And In Recent Years They Have Had A Crucial Influence On Other Arts: Cinema, Literature, Music And Visual Arts. They Stand At The Crossroads Between Very Diverse Forms Of Culture And Product, And It Is Precisely The Anomaly Inherent In This Encounter/Clash That Makes Them So Terribly Interesting. Neoludica Is An In-Depth Exploration Of The Relationship Between Art And Video Games, And It Underlines How The Video Game (An Interactive Multimedia Work) Is An Art Form That Has Yet To Be Understood By The World Of Culture. The Interactive Dimension Is A Facet That Has Attracted Art Since The Advent Of Environmental Installations During The Sixties, And It Is A Dimension That Has Since Been Developed In Digital Art Through Video Installations. The Video Game/Art Contamination Occurs Not Only On The Aesthetic Level, But Also Through Those Elements Of Language Which Can Be Defined As Conceptual, Such As Interactivity Mentioned Above.

When Broadway Went To Hollywood,Ethan Mordden,4.0,1.0,,,"The Wizard Of Oz, Gigi, Top Hat, High Society - Some Of The Most Popular Movie Musicals Ever Made Were Written By Broadway Songwriters. The Sound Of Music, Chicago, West Side Story, The Music Man, Grease - Some Of The Other Most Popular Movie Musicals Were Adaptations Of Broadway Shows. From The Very First Talkies To The Present, Broadway'S Composers And Lyricists Have Given Much Of Their Best Work To The Movies - But With Varying Results. In The 1930S, Rodgers And Hart'S Love Me Tonight, With Maurice Chevalier And Jeanette Macdonald At Their Sexiest, Is A Masterpiece Of Fairytale Sophistication. But Hallelujah, I'M A Bum, An Al Jolson Vehicle About Tramps In Central Park, Is One Of The Outstanding Flops, Partly Because Rodgers And Hart Wrote It As A Kind Of Opera That Is Spoken Instead Of Sung. Or Take The Big Films Based On Broadway Shows In The 1960S. After The Sound Of Music, Hollywood Sought To Fill The Screen With Lots Of Scenery, Lots Of Drama, And Lots Of Julie Andrews. But Camelot And Hello, Dolly! Had Too Much Scenery, Paint Your Wagon Was The Hippie Musical, And Song Of Norway Was Simply Loony.

""I Think You'D Better."" I Tried To Sit, But She Was Clinging To Me Too Tightly. ""I'Ll Scream,"" She Whispered Into My Ear, Her Breath Hot Against My Neck. ""You Will Not."" I Edged My Way Out From Under Her. I Heard Her Intake Of Breath And Knew She Really Meant To Do It. What Was Wrong With Her? Panicked, I Rolled Onto Her, Finding Her Mouth With My Hand In The Dark And Pressing It There, Hard. ""Button It!"" I Hissed, Feeling Her Wiggling And Squirming Underneath Me.

Suggested Cinema Rating Pg. A Quick Word With The Author Q - So, Tell Us About The K’Barthan Series. What Made You Write It? What Makes It Special? A - As A Reader, I Have Always Loved British Satire And Humor Or Humour. I Love Comedic Sci Fi And Fantasy And I Love Funny; Funny Epic Fantasy Series Like The Discworld Novels And Comedic Sci Fi Like Douglas Adams Totally Floats My Boat. But I Also Like A Gripping Tale That Zips Along Quickly In The Time Honoured Tradition Of Unputdownable Adventure. And Of Course, I Like Genre Fiction Mashups; Douglas Adams Meets Startrek And James Bond - And A Dash Of Romance (But No Squelchy Bits). Therefore, My Cunning Gambit Was Fantasy That Was Also Science Fiction And Would Surprise Even Me. I Wanted A Fast Paced Story And Gripping Tale But Comedy In The Tradition Of All The Great Funny British Authors. The K'Barthan Series Does Have A Deeper Side. Sure On One Level It'S A Light Piece Of Witty Comedy Fiction But On Another Level It'S About Teamwork; Team Action In Science Fiction - Or Fantasy. Our Heros And Heroines Work Together Across The Series To Bring Down The Indomitable Forces Of Evil (Bit Of An Untrendy Epic Fantasy Trope There But I Like It). You Won'T Find Standard Mythic Creatures In My Sci Fi - I Couldn'T Face The Deluge Of Emails I'D Inevitably Get From Those Who Knew More About Them Than I Do, Telling Me I'D Got Them Wrong.

From Six Feet Swamp Things With Antennae To Cute Furry Creatures Like The Blurpons, With Their Fluffy Ears, Big Button Eyes And Penchant For Extreme Violence. The K’Barthan Population Has Variety.

Would The K'Barthan Series Fit On The List? A – Oh Yes. I Wrote It Entirely For Me. If Anyone Else Likes It, That’S Gravy. I Love British Humour, Especially Satire And Parody In Sci Fi And Fantasy: People Like Pratchett And Adams. There’S So Much Texture And Depth In Their Books. I Think If You'Re Funny You Can Be Harder Hitting And Setting It All In A Parallel Reality Helps. Q – Do You Have A Target Reader? A – It'S More A Mind Set And An Approach To Life I'M Reaching Out To. Sure, I Wrote It With My (Then) Teenage Nephew In Mind - But To Give You An Idea; The Oldest Fan Of The Series I Know Of Is In His 90S And The Youngest Is 10.

Howard Hid In The Concrete Stairwells At Night, While His Parents Turned Their Apartment Into A Den Of Illegal Activity, Serving The Local Population Of Gambler And Drinkers. By Day He Learned The Hard Lessons Of The Project Playgrounds, As Well As The Consolations Of A Working-Class Community'S Spirit.

Examining How Writers Of The Day Engaged With Such Questions, Victorian Pain Offers A Compelling New Literary And Philosophical History Of Modern Pain. Rachel Ablow Provides Close Readings Of Novelists Charlotte Brontë And Thomas Hardy And Political And Natural Philosophers John Stuart Mill, Harriet Martineau, And Charles Darwin, As Well As A Variety Of Medical, Scientific, And Popular Writers Of The Victorian Age. She Explores How Discussions Of Pain Served As Investigations Into The Status Of Persons And The Nature And Parameters Of Social Life. No Longer Conceivable As Divine Trial Or Punishment, Pain In The Nineteenth Century Came To Seem Instead Like A Historical Accident Suggesting Little Or Nothing About The Individual Who Suffers. A Landmark Study Of Victorian Literature And The History Of Pain, Victorian Pain Shows How These Writers Came To See Pain As A Social As Well As A Personal Problem.

The Two Greatest Ideas,Linda Trinkaus Zagzebski,,,,,"Two Simple Yet Tremendously Powerful Ideas That Shaped Virtually Every Aspect Of Civilization This Book Is A Breathtaking Examination Of The Two Greatest Ideas In Human History. The First Is The Idea That The Human Mind Can Grasp The Universe. The Second Is The Idea That The Human Mind Can Grasp Itself. Acclaimed Philosopher Linda Zagzebski Shows How The First Unleashed A Cultural Awakening That Swept Across The World In The First Millennium Bce, Giving Birth To Philosophy, Mathematics, Science, And Virtually All The Major World Religions. It Dominated Until The Renaissance, When The Discovery Of Subjectivity Profoundly Transformed The Arts And Sciences. This Second Great Idea Governed Our Perception Of Reality Up Until The Dawn Of The Twenty-First Century. Zagzebski Explores How The Interplay Of The Two Ideas Led To Conflicts That Have Left Us Ambivalent About The Relationship Between The Mind And The Universe, And Have Given Rise To A Host Of Moral And Political Rifts Over The Deepest Questions Human Beings Face. Should We Organize Civil Society Around The Ideal Of Living In Harmony With The World Or That Of Individual Autonomy? Zagzebski Explains How The Two Greatest Ideas Continue To Divide Us Today Over Issues Such As Abortion, The Environment, Free Speech, And Racial And Gender Identity.

Clausewitz,Donald J. Stoker,,,,,"Carl Von Clausewitz'S On War, His Chef D'Oeuvre Of Strategic And Military Theory, Was First Published In 1832, After His Death. The Book Remains A Touchstone, Dissected And Debated By Scholars, Students, And Military Personnel Around The World Who Consider It The Founding Document Of The Field. Yet To Clausewitz Himself, Far More Important Than Achieving Recognition For His Written Works Was Glory On The Field Of Battle. He Dreamed Of Winning Renown Not With His Pen, But With His Sword, And Wielded Both With The Same Determination And Zeal. In This New Biographical Study Of Clausewitz, Donald Stoker Moves Skillfully Between His Career As A Soldier And His Work As A Theoretician. Conventional Wisdom Holds That Clausewitz Was ""Merely A Staff Officer"" Who Didn'T See Much Combat, But Stoker Shows This To Be Far From True. As A Soldier During The Era Of The French Revolution And Napoleonic Wars - Perhaps The Most Intense Period Of Continuous Large-Scale Warfare In History - Clausewitz Gained An Enormous Amount Of Battle Experience. By Reconstructing His Role In Various Compaigns, From Jena-Auerstedt To Waterloo, This Work Offers New Insights Into Clausewitz As Both A Soldier In An A Witness To The Momentous Fighting Of His Time. Taking Readers Through The Heat Of These Battles, Stoker Provides Historical Overview And Strategic Analysis, Showing The Connection Between Events And Clausewitz'S Own Words, Taken Both From His Works And The Abundant Letters Written To His Wife, Marie, And Friends Throughout His Life. Clausewitz'S Contributions To Military Theory Have Solidified His Reputation, Which Seems Continually To Rise, And Stoker Assesses Each Of His Significant Works And Their Contribution To His Legacy. Grounding Clausewitz'S Theoretical Analyses On The Field Of Battle, Stoker Traces The Road To On War, And Provides An Absorbing Reassessment Of Both The Warrior And The Theorist. -- From Dust Jacket.","Oxford University Press, Usa",377.0,English,2014,"Biography &Amp, Autobiography , Military",9780199357949

He Represents Toughness, Focus, Determination, And The Ideal Of Achievement In The Face Of Overwhelming Odds. He Was The Most Feared And Respected Adversary To His Enemies And An Object Of Envy, Admiration, And Sometimes, Scorn To His Professional Peers. An Early Proponent Of Tank Warfare, George S. Patton Moved From Being A Foresighted Lieutenant In The First World War To Commanding The Third Army In The Next, Leading Armored Divisions In The Allied Offensive That Broke The Back Of Nazi Germany. Patton Was An Enigmatic Figure. His Image Among His Troops And Much Of The Press Achieved Legendary Status Through His Bold And Colorful Comments And Combat Leadership, Yet These Same Qualities Nearly Jeopardized His Career And Forced Him Out Of The Battle On Several Occasions. Victory Was Impossible Without Patton, And Returning To The Field, His Army Was Responsible For One Of The Most Crushing Advances In The History Of Warfare.

Information Storage And Retrieval Systems,"Gerald J. Kowalski', 'Mark T. Maybury",,,,,"Chapter 1 Places Into Perspective A Total Information Storage And Retrieval System. This Perspective Introduces New Challenges To The Problems That Need To Be Theoretically Addressed And Commercially Implemented. Ten Years Ago Commercial Implementation Of The Algorithms Being Developed Was Not Realistic, Allowing Theoreticians To Limit Their Focus To Very Specific Areas. Bounding A Problem Is Still Essential In Deriving Theoretical Results. But The Commercialization And Insertion Of This Technology Into Systems Like The Internet That Are Widely Being Used Changes The Way Problems Are Bounded. From A Theoretical Perspective, Efficient Scalability Of Algorithms To Systems With Gigabytes And Terabytes Of Data, Operating With Minimal User Search Statement Information, And Making Maximum Use Of All Functional Aspects Of An Information System Need To Be Considered. The Dissemination Systems Using Persistent Indexes Or Mail Files To Modify Ranking Algorithms And Combining The Search Of Structured Information Fields And Free Text Into A Consolidated Weighted Output Are Examples Of Potential New Areas Of Investigation. The Best Way For The Theoretician Or The Commercial Developer To Understand The Importance Of Problems To Be Solved Is To Place Them In The Context Of A Total Vision Of A Complete System.

He Tells Of Finding In A Biography Of Proust The Solid Details Of What He Had Previously Encountered Through That Writer'S Subjective Sensibility, But He Acknowledges That There Can Be Other Reasons For Attending To The Genre. If The Reader Is Also A Writer, A Desire To Learn The Details Of A Fellow'S Craft May Come Into Play. Or In A Diagnostic Mood, Readers May Seek To Relate Features Of A Writer'S Achievement To The Psychological And Physical Circumstances In Which It Occurred.

In Doing So, The Book Serves As A Valuable Counterbalance To The Now Mainstream View That Emotions Are Representational Mental States. Beginning With A Defence Of A Feeling Theory Of Emotion, Whiting Opens Up A Whole New Way Of Thinking About The Role And Centrality Of Emotion In Our Lives, Showing How Emotion Is Key To A Proper Understanding Of Human Motivation And The Self. Whiting Establishes That Emotions As Types Of Bodily Feelings Serve As The Categorical Bases For Our Behavioural Dispositions, Including Those Associated With Moral Thought, Virtue, And Vice. The Book Concludes By Advancing The Idea That Emotions Make Up Our Intrinsic Nature - The Characterisation Of What We Are Like In And Of Ourselves, When Considered Apart From How We Are Disposed To Behave.

Moreover, The Country Is An Active Member Of The International Conservation Community By Fulfilling Its Implementation Of Various Multilateral Environment Agreements. While It Emerged Into The 21St Century As One Of The 36 Global Terrestrial “Hotspots” In Biological Diversity Conservation Ranks, Bhutan’S Sheer Commitment With More Than 51% Of Its Territory Being Managed Under The Explicit Status Of A Protected Area Network, And More Than 70% Of The Land Under Forest Cover, Represents Bhutan’S Exemplary Dedication To Protect The Planet Despite Its Smallness In Size And Economy, And The Biological Fragility Exemplified By Its Hotspot Situation. In The Face Of Imminent Severe Threats Of Global Warming, Bhutan Nonetheless Exemplifies The Truth That “A Small Country With A Big Conservation Commitment” Can Make An Enormous Contribution To The Global Community.

Understanding Popular Culture,John Fiske,5.0,1.0,,,"This Revised Edition Of A Now Classic Text Includes A New Introduction By Henry Jenkins, Explaining ‘Why Fiske Still Matters’ For Today’S Students, Followed By A Discussion Between Former Fiske Students Kevin Glynn, Jonathan Gray, And Pamela Wilson On The Theme Of ‘Reading Fiske And Understanding The Popular’. Both Underline The Continuing Relevance Of This Foundational Text In The Study Of Popular Culture. What Is Popular Culture? How Does It Differ From Mass Culture? And What Do Popular ""Texts"" Reveal About Class, Race, And Gender Dynamics In A Society? John Fiske Answers These And A Host Of Other Questions In Understanding Popular Culture. When It Was First Written, Understanding Popular Culture Took A Groundbreaking Approach To Studying Such Cultural Artifacts As Jeans, Shopping Malls, Tabloid Newspapers, And Tv Game Shows, Which Remains Relevant Today. Fiske Differentiates Between Mass Culture – The Cultural ""Products"" Put Out By An Industrialized, Capitalist Society – And Popular Culture – The Ways In Which People Use, Abuse, And Subvert These Products To Create Their Own Meanings And Messages. Rather Than Focusing On Mass Culture’S Attempts To Dominate And Homogenize, He Prefers To Look At (And Revel In) Popular Culture’S Evasions And Manipulations Of These Attempts. Designed As A Companion To Reading The Popular, Understanding Popular Culture Presents A Radically Different Theory Of What It Means For Culture To Be Popular: That It Is, Literally, Of The People. It Is Not Imposed On Them, It Is Created By Them, And Its Pleasures And Meanings Reflect Popular Tastes And Concerns – And A Rejection Of Those Fostered By Mass Culture. With Wit, Clarity, And Insight, Professor Fiske Debunks The Myth Of The Mindless Mass Audience, And Demonstrates That, In Myriad Ways, Popular Culture Thrives Because That Audience Is More Aware Than Anyone Guesses.",Routledge,170.0,English,2010-10-08,"Art , Popular Culture",9781136868702

Africa In The American Imagination,Carol Magee,,,,,"In The American World, The Presence Of African Culture Is Sometimes Fully Embodied And Sometimes Leaves Only A Trace.

Because These Cultural Icons Permeate American Life, They Represent The Broader U.S. Culture And Its Relationship To African Culture. This Study Integrates Approaches From Art History And Visual Culture Studies With Those From Culture, Race, And Popular Culture Studies To Analyze This Interchange. Two Major Threads Weave Throughout. One Analyzes How The Presentation Of African Visual Culture In These Popular Culture Forms Conceptualizes Africa For The American Public. The Other Investigates The Way The Uses Of African Visual Culture Focuses America'S Own Self-Awareness, Particularly Around Black And White Racialized Identities. In Exploring The Multiple Meanings That “Africa” Has In American Popular Culture, Africa In The American Imagination Argues That These Cultural Products Embody Multiple Perspectives And Speak To Various Sociopolitical Contexts: The Cold War, Civil Rights, And Contemporary Eras Of The United States; The Apartheid And Post-Apartheid Eras Of South Africa; The Colonial And Postcolonial Eras Of Ghana; And The European Era Of African Colonization.",Univ.

Usually, It Consists Of Learning How To Adopt Several Common Approaches When Doing Research, And How To Conceive A Research Design (Often Leading To A Survey). This Usually Leads To Collecting Data On A Modest Scale And – When The Opportunity Arises – Analysing The Data With The Help Of Some Statistics. Ask The Students Of Their Opinion At The End Of Such A Course And They Tend To Heave A Deep Sigh Of Relief And Say, “I Have Got Through It. ” Then Their Real Courses Start Again, In Which Methodology Often Does Not Play A Role At All. We Are Of The Opinion That Writing-Off Methodology In This Way Is A Real Pity. It Ignores The Valuable Role That Methodology Should Play In Academic Teaching As A Whole. Here, Methodology Is Presented As A Form Of Thinking And Acting That, While Obviously Entailing Research Work, Can Also Include The Design And Change Of Organisations. This Broad Approach Has Been Purposefully Chosen, As It Is Almost Obvious From Research And Graduation Projects That The Students Do Not Really Have A Clue What Methodology Involves And, Therefore, Wasting Their Time By Producing Work That Has A Little Quality.",Springer Science & Business Media,171.0,English,2010-03-10,"Business &Amp, Economics , Management Science",9783540716594

Emotion And Adaptation,Richard S. Lazarus,,,,,"In This Landmark Work, Richard Lazarus -- One Of The World'S Foremost Authorities -- Offers A Comprehensive Treatment Of The Psychology Of Emotion, Its Role In Adaptation, And The Issues That Must Be Addressed To Understand It. The Work Provides A Complete Theory Of Emotional Processes, Explaining How Different Emotions Are Elicited And Expressed, And How The Emotional Range Of Individuals Develops Over Their Lifetime. The Author'S Approach Puts Emotion In A Central Role As A Complex, Patterned, Organic Reaction To Both Daily Events And Long-Term Efforts On The Part Of The Individual To Survive, Flourish, And Achieve. In His View, Emotions Cannot Be Divorced From Other Functions--Whether Biological, Social, Or Cognitive--And Express The Intimate, Personal Meaning Of What Individuals Experience. As Coping And Adapting Processes, They Are Seen As Part Of The Ongoing Effort To Monitor Changes, Stimuli, And Stresses Arising From The Environment. After Defining Emotion And Discussing Issues Of Classification And Measurement, Lazarus Turns To The Topics Of Motivation, Cognition, And Causality As Key Concepts In This Theory. Next He Looks At Individual Emotions, Both Negative And Positive, And Examines Their Development In Terms Of Social Influences And Individual Events. Finally, He Considers The Long-Term Consequences Of Emotion On Physical Health And Well-Being, And The Treatment And Prevention Of Emotional Dysfunction.

The Emotions,Peter Goldie,3.0,2.0,,,"Peter Goldie Opens The Path To A Deeper Understanding Of Our Emotional Lives Through A Lucid Philosophical Exploration Of This Surprisingly Neglected Topic. He Illuminates The Phenomena Of Emotion By Drawing Not Only On Philosophy But Also On Literature And Science. He Considers The Roles Of Culture And Evolution In The Development Of Our Emotional Capabilities. He Examines The Links Between Emotion, Mood, And Character, And Places The Emotions In The Context Of Such Related Phenomena As Consciousness, Thought, Feeling, And Imagination. He Explains How It Is That We Are Able To Make Sense Of Our Own And Other People'S Emotions, And How We Can Explain The Very Human Things Which Emotions Lead Us To Do. A Key Theme Of The Emotions Is The Idea Of A Personal Perspective Or Point Of View, Contrasted With The Impersonal Stance Of The Empirical Sciences. Goldie Argues That It Is Only From The Personal Point Of View That Thoughts, Reasons, Feelings, And Actions Come Into View. He Suggests That There Is A Tendency For Philosophers To Over-Intellectualize The Emotions, And Investigates How Far It Is Possible To Explain Emotions In Terms Of Rationality. Over-Intellectualizing Can Also Involve Neglecting The Centrality Of Feelings, And Goldie Shows How To Put Them Where They Belong, As Part Of The Intentionality Of Emotional Experience, Directed Towards The World From A Point Of View. Goldie Argues That The Various Elements Of Emotional Experience—Including Thought, Feeling, Bodily Change, And Expression—Are Tied Together In A Narrative Structure. To Make Sense Of One'S Emotional Life One Has To See It As Part Of A Larger Unfolding Narrative. The Narrative Is Not Simply An Interpretative Framework Of A Life: It Is What That Life Is. Goldie Concludes By Applying These Ideas In A Close Study Of One Particular Emotion: Jealousy. This Fascinating Book Gives An Accessible But Penetrating Exploration Of A Subject That Is Important But Mysterious To All Of Us.

Emotions,Stephanie H.M. Van Goozen,,,,,"Based Upon Lectures Presented At An Invitational Colloquium In Honor Of Nico Frijda, This Collection Of Essays Represents A Brief And Up-To-Date Overview Of The Field Of Emotions, Their Significance And How They Function. For Most, Emotions Are Simply What We Feel, Giving Our Lives Affective Value. Scientists Approach Emotions Differently -- Some Considering The ""Feeling"" Aspect To Be Of Little Relevance To Their Research Questions. Some Investigators Consider Emotions From A Phenomenological Perspective, While Others Believe That The Psychophysiological Bases Of The Emotions Are Of Prime Importance, And Still Others Observe And Study Animals In Order To Generate Hypotheses About Human Emotions. Containing Essays Which Represent Each Of These Approaches, This Book Is In One Sense A Heterogenous Collection. Nevertheless, The Variety Of Approaches And Interests Come Together, Since These Scholars Are All Operating From A More Or Less Cognitive Psychological Orientation And Use The Same Conceptual Reference Scheme. Written By Experts In Their Own Area, The Essays Reflect The Richness Of Research In Emotions. Whether These Approaches And Opinions Can Be Harmonized Into A Single Theory Of Emotions Is A Question Which The Future Will Have To Answer.",Psychology Press,348.0,English,2013-10-31,"Psychology , Emotions",9781317759898

The First Soldier,Stephen G.

The Author Of Three Highly Acclaimed Books On The Era, Stephen Fritz Upends This Characterization Of Hitler As An Ill-Informed Fantasist And Demonstrates The Ways In Which His Strategy Was Coherent And Even Competent. That Hitler Saw World War Ii As The Only Way To Retrieve Germany’S Fortunes And Build An Expansionist Thousand-Year Reich Is Uncontroversial. But While His Generals Did Sometimes Object To Hitler’S Tactics And Operational Direction, They Often Made The Same Errors In Judgment And Were In Agreement Regarding Larger Strategic And Political Goals. A Necessary Volume For Understanding The Influence Of World War I On Hitler’S Thinking, This Work Is Also An Eye-Opening Reappraisal Of Major Events Like The Invasion Of Russia And The Battle For Normandy. “Perhaps The Best Account We Have To Date Of Hitler’S Military Leadership.

General Mark Clark,Jon B. Mikolashek,,,,,"Although Not Nearly As Well Known As Other U.S. Army Senior Commanders, General Mark Clark Is One Of The Four Menñalong With Eisenhower, Patton, And Bradleyñwho Historian Martin Blumenson Called Òthe Essential Quartet Of American Leaders Who Achieved Victory In Europe.Ó Eisenhower Nicknamed Him The American Eagle. A Skilled Staff Officer, Clark Rose Quickly Through The Ranks, And By The Time America Entered The War He Was Deputy Commander Of Allied Forces In North Africa. Several Weeks Before Operation Torch, Clark Landed By Submarine In A Daring Mission To Negotiate The Cooperation Of The Vichy French. He Was Subsequently Named Commander Of U.S. Fifth Army And Tasked With The Invasion Of Italy. Fifth Army And Mark Clark Are Virtually Synonymous. From The September 1943 Landing At Salerno, Clark And His Army Fought Their Way North Against Skilled German Resistance, Augmented By Mountainous Terrain. The Daring January 1944 End-Run At Anzio, Although Not Immediately Successful, Set The Stage For Fifth Armyõs Liberation Of Rome On 4 June 1944, After Ten Months Of Hard Fighting. The War In Italy Was Not Over, But The Taking Of Rome Intact Was A Tremendous Achievement. Pitted Against One Of Hitlerõs Most Able Commanders, Field Marshal Albert Kesselring, Fifth Army Spent Another Ten Months In Ferocious Combat From The Gothic Line To The Po Valley, As Clark Moved Up To Head All Allied Ground Forces In Italy As Commander Of 15Th Army Group. The Brutal Italian Campaign Has Been Long Overshadowed By D-Day And The Campaign Across France And Into Germany. Likewise, The Senior U.S. Commander In Italy Has Been Largely Overlooked When One Thinks Of The Great Captains Of The War. The Author, Mikolashek Remedies This Situation, Shedding Much Needed Historical Light On One Of Americaõs Most Important Fighting Generals In This Òwarts And Alló Biography.

Dogface Soldier,Wilson A. Heefner,,,,,"On July 11, 1943, General Lucian Truscott Received The Army'S Second-Highest Decoration, The Distinguished Service Cross, For Valor In Action In Sicily. During His Career He Also Received The Army Distinguished Service Medal With Oak Leaf Cluster, The Navy Distinguished Service Medal, The Legion Of Merit, And The Purple Heart. Truscott Was One Of The Most Significant Of All U.S. Army Generals In World War Ii, Pioneering New Combat Training Methods—Including The Famous “Truscott Trot”— And Excelling As A Combat Commander, Turning The Third Infantry Division Into One Of The Finest Divisions In The U.S. Army. He Was Instrumental In Winning Many Of The Most Important Battles Of The War, Participating In The Invasions Of North Africa, Sicily, Anzio, And Southern France. Truscott Was Not Only Respected By His Peers And “Dogfaces”—Common Soldiers—Alike But Also Ranked By President Eisenhower As Second Only To Patton, Whose Command He Took Over On October 8, 1945, And Led Until April 1946. Yet No Definitive History Of His Life Has Been Compiled. Wilson Heefner Corrects That With The First Authoritative Biography Of This Distinguished American Military Leader. Heefner Has Undertaken Impressive Research In Primary Sources—As Well As Interviews With Family Members And Former Associates—To Shed New Light On This Overlooked Hero. He Presents Truscott As A Soldier Who Was Shaped By His Upbringing, Civilian And Military Education, Family Life, Friendships, And Evolving Experiences As A Commander Both In And Out Of Combat. Heefner’S Brisk Narrative Explores Truscott’S Career Through His Three Decades In The Army And Defines His Roles In Key Operations. It Also Examines Truscott’S Postwar Role As Military Governor Of Bavaria, Particularly In Improving Living Conditions For Jewish Displaced Persons, Removing Nazis From Civil Government, And Assisting In The Trials Of German War Criminals.

The Power Of Morality In Movements,"Anders Sevelsted', 'Jonas Toubøl",,,,,"This Open Access Book Explores The Role Of Morality In Social Movements. Morality Has Always Been Central To Social Movements Whether It Be In The Form Of The Moral Foundations Of Movement Claims, Politics And Ideologies, The Values Motivating Participation, The New Moral Principles Envisioned And Practiced Among Movement Participants, Or The Overall Struggle Over Society’S Moral Values That Movements Engage In. This Is Evident In Movements Emerging From Recent Interlinked Crises: The Crisis Of Human Rights, The Climate Crisis, And The Developing Crisis Of Democracy. In Analyzing These Current Events Through A Variety Of Theoretical, Methodological, And Empirical Lenses, This Book Brings Morality To The Forefront Of The Discussion, Allowing For A Rethinking Of Its Role. The Book Is Divided Into Five Parts. The First Part Introduces And Explores The Central Concept Of The Book, Outlining The Dominant Existing Approaches To Morality And Ethics In The Extant Movement And Civil Society Literature. The Following Three Parts Investigate Morality In Relation To Topics And Movements That Are Either Prominent To Contemporary Politics Or Salient To The Question Of Morality. In These Empirically Informed Parts, The Authors Apply A Diverse Selection Of Methods Spanning Fieldwork, Historiography, Traditional And Novel Statistical Analytical Methods, And Big Data Analysis To A Diverse Selection Of Data. Topics Discussed Include Refugee Solidarity Movements, Male Privilege And Anti-Feminism Movement, Environmental And Climate Justice Movements, And Religious Activism. The Fifth And Closing Part Of The Book Focuses On The More Abstract Theoretical Question Of The Relationship Between Morality And Ethics And Activist Practices And Points To Future Research Agendas.

Social Problems And Social Movements,Harry H. Bash,,,,,"Sociology Is Becoming Fragmented. With Specialised Fields Spinning Off Beyond The Capacity Of A Unifying Theoretical Frame To Embrace Them, The Prospect Exists That Sociology'S Vital Centre May Not Hold. Proceeding From A Social Constructionist Perspective, This Work Examines The Existence And Probes The Origins Of The Specialised Sociological Fields Of Social Problems And Social Movements. Conceptual Ambiguities That Currently Plague Both Specialisations Are Noted, As Are Their Effective Theoretical Isolation From General Sociological Theory. Each Field Is Traced To Its Roots In Sociology'S Formative Period In The Nineteenth Century. Two Modes Of Doing Sociology Are Found To Have Evolved, Respectively, In The United Stales And In Continental Europe, Each Conditioned By Distinctive Historical Experiences And Resonating With The Prevailing Social And Political Concerns On The Two Continents. American Sociology Emerged In Response To Social Perceptions That Progress Is Inhibited By A Proliferation Of 'Social Problems'. Continental European Sociology Arose In Reaction To Enlightenment Principles Failing To Be Institutionalised, Inviting The Perceived Social Threat Of Either Revolution Or Anarchy. Both Sociologies Are Thus Seen As Ideologically Contaminated, And Their Respective Dominant Perspectives, Through The 1950S, Are Contrasted As The 'Social Problem Orientation' And The 'Social Movement Orientation'. Comparative Analysis Of These Orientatations Probes Such Issues As Ahistorical Vs. Historical Treatments: Methodological Individualism Vs. Collectivism: Differential Conceptions Of Class; The Discipline'S Need To Inhibit Ideological Contagion Through A Sociological Reconstruction Of Prevailing Social Constructions Of Reality; The Vital Distinction Between Structural And Processual Conceptualisations. The Study Concludes That Temporality Serves As A Crucial But Much-Neglected Dimension In Much Of American Sociology. So-Called Social Problems And Social Movements Are Found To Be Grounded In Essentially Similar Empirical Social Circumstances, With Their Alternate Conceptualisations Attributable To Differential Time-Frames Through Which Such Circumstances Are Sociologically Apprehended. This Points To The Potential Theoretical Integration Of These Two Fields. Scientific, Ideological. And Social Policy Implications Of Alternative Constructions Of Reality Are Also Explored.",Humanity Books,0.0,English,1995,"Philosophy , Movements , General",9781573924368

Environmental Dispute Resolution,"Lawrence S. Bacow', 'Michael Wheeler",,,,,"This Book Has Its Origins In An M.I.T. Research Project That Was Funded By The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (Epa). Our Immediate Objective Was To Prepare A Set Of Case Studies That Examined Bargaining And Negotiation As They Occurred Between Government, Environmental Advocates, And Regulatees Throughout The Traditional Regulatory Process. The Project Was Part Of A Larger Effort By The Epa To Make Environmental Regulation More Efficient And Less Litigious. The Principal Investigator For The Research Effort Was Lawrence Sus Skind Of The Department Of Urban Studies And Planning. Eight Case Studies Were Prepared Under The Joint Supervision Of Susskind And The Authors Of This Book. Studying The Negotiating Behavior Of Parties As We Worked Our Way Through An Environmental Dispute Proved Enlightening. We Observed Missed Oppor Tunities For Settlement, Negotiating Tactics That Backfired, And Strategies That Ap Peared To Be Grounded More In Intuition Than In Thoughtful Analysis. At The Same Time, However, We Were Struck By How Often The Parties Ultimately Managed To Muddle Through. People Negotiated Not Out Of Some Idealistic Commitment To Consensus But Because They Thought It Better Served Their Own Interests. When Some Negotiations Reached An Impasse, People Improvised Mediation.

Environmental Legislation, In Particular, Has Greatly Enhanced The Rights And Powers Of Organized Groups That Desire To Participate In Local Development Decisions. These Powers Have Allowed Citizen Groups To Block Undesired And Socially Unacceptable Projects, Such As Highways Through Urban Areas And Sprawling Suburban Developments. At The Same Time, These Powers Have Produced A Collective Inability To Construct Many Needed Projects That Produce Adverse Local Impacts. Prisons, Airports, Hos Pitals, Waste Treatment Plants, And Energy Facilities All Face Years Of Liti Gation Before A Final Decision. At Times, Prolonged Litigation Has Pro Duced Especially High Costs To All Participants. Despite These New Powers, Citizen Action Has Often Been Limited To Participation In Public Hearings Or Adjudicatory Proceedings. Typically, This Occurs So Late In The Decision Process That Citizen Input Has Very Little Affect In Shaping A Project'S Design.

The Holding Company And Corporate Control,Herman P. Daems,5.0,1.0,,,"1. Research Subject And Objectives This Study Focuses On An Economic Institution, The Large Industrial Holding Company, Which Continues To Hold A Prominent If Not A Strategic Position In The Resource Allocation Process In Many Industrialised Market Economies. Powerful Multicompany Combines Like The Famous Japanese Zaibatsu And The Less Familiar But Equally Powerful European Industrial Groups Rely On The Institution Of The Holding Company To Tie Their Intermarket Control Network Together. Two General Questions Arise From This Situation: First, What Factors Account For The Viability And Growth Within A Market Setting Of Those Institutions Which Internalise Allocation Decisions And, Second, What Effect Do Such Institutions Have On Resource Allocation? These Questions Provide The Framework In Which The Proper Research Subject Can Be Most Adequately Introduced. Before Doing So, It Is Crucial To Point Out That The Holding Company Institution, As Analyzed In Subsequent Chapters, Should Not Be Confounded With The Legal Constructs, Bearing The Same Generic Name And Flourishing In Fiscal Paradises, Whose Sole Function Is To Organise Tax Evasion Across National Boundaries. The Institution, As Studied Here, Is The Large Holding Company Through Which Industrial Groups Manage Multicompany Systems. Such Multicompany Systems, Operating An Intermarket Network By Means Of Holding Companies, Continue To Be More Typical For Europe And Japan Than For The United States Where, For Legal Reasons, But Also Because Of Managerial Efficiency, The Multicompany System Built Around The Holding Company Institution Was Rather Short-Lived And 1 The Giant Integrated Multiunit Enterprise Rose To Dominance Instead.",Springer Science & Business Media,145.0,English,2012-12-06,"Business &Amp, Economics , Industries , General",9781461340560

Human Motivation And Interpersonal Relationships,Netta Weinstein,,,,,"This Volume Summarizes And Organizes A Growing Body Of Research Supporting The Role Of Motivation In Adaptive And Rewarding Interpersonal Interactions With Others. The Field Of Human Motivation Is Rapidly Growing But Most Studies Have Focused On The Effects Of Motivation On Individuals' Personal Happiness And Task Engagement. Only Recently Have Theorists And Empiricists Begun To Recognize That Dispositional And State Motivations Impact The Ways Individuals Approach Interpersonal Interactions. In Addition, Researchers Are Now Recognizing That The Quality Of Interpersonal Interactions Influences Consequent Happiness And Task Engagement, Thus Helping To Explain Previous Findings To This End. Similarly Social Psychology And Relationships Researchers Have Focused On The Impact Of Cognitions, Emotions, And Behaviors On People'S Relationships. In Their Work, Relationships Researchers Demonstrate That Both Contextual Characteristics And Individual Differences Influence The Quality Of Interactions. Many Of These Studies Seek To Understand Which Characteristics Strengthen The Bonds Between People, Encourage Empathy And Trust And Create A Sense Of Well-Being After A Close Interaction. This Work Seeks To Integrate The Field Of Human Motivation And Interpersonal Relationships. Both Fields Have Seen Extensive Growth In The Past Decade And Each Can Contribute To The Other. However, No Single Compiled Work Is Available That Targets Both Fields. This Is The Case, In Part Because Only Now Is There Enough Work To Make A Strong And Compelling Case For Their Integration. In The Previous Years, Research Has Been Conducted To Show That Motivation Is Relevant And Important For Interactions Among Strangers And In Close Relationships. In Addition Developmental Mechanisms For These Relations Are Identified And Mechanisms By Which Motivation Strengthens People'S Relationships. Finally Recent Work Has Demonstrated The Many Implications For Interpersonal Relationships, Showing That Motivation Impacts A Range Of Interpersonal Processes From Prejudice Regulation And Objectification Of Others To Empathy And Care. This Book Seeks To Summarize And Organize All These Findings And Present Them In A Way That Is Relevant To Both Motivation Researchers And Social And Relationship Researchers.",Springer Science & Business Media,360.0,English,2014-07-08,"Psychology , Interpersonal Relations",9789401785426
"Conflict, Power, And Games","James T. Tedeschi', 'Barry R. Schlenker', 'Thomas V. Bonoma",,,,,"The Technological Revolution In The Social Sciences Made Available A Set Of Research Tools And Data Manipulation Techniques That Permit The Study Of Complex Social Processes Previously Inaccessible Or Not Amenable To Our Observational Powers. One Important Set Of Tools Took The Generic Title ""Experimental Games,"" Which Were Characterized By The Interactive Protagonists' Pursuit Of Relatively Well-Defined Goals Whose Achievement Is Dependent On The Behavior Of Others. James T. Tedeschi, Barry R. Schlenker, And Thomas V. Bonoma, In This Work, Explicate These Highly Structured Interactions. The Grand Strategy Of Scientific Inquiry Is The Development Of Explanatory Systems For Natural Phenomena. The Empirical Tactics Devised To Manipulate, Control, Observe, And Measure Events Or Processes Of Interest Often Require As Much Ingenuity And Imagination As Theory Development Itself. Generally The Situation Is So Structured That Certain Rules Govern Participant Behavior. Within These Constraints The Social Psychological Processes Of Conflict, Influence, Power, Bargaining, And Coalition Formation Can Be Studied. Concerned With The More Formal And Technical Aspects Of Games, The Authors Explain How They Are Used For Purposes Of Developing And Testing Scientific Theory. The Emphasis Throughout Is On The Development And Empirical Evaluation Of A Scientific Theory Of Social Influence And Power In Situations Where The Interests Of The Interacting Parties Are In Conflict. Experimental Games Have Provided Many Of The Concepts And The Preponderance Of Evidence That Have Helped To Unravel Many Of The Complexities Of Social Behavior.

The Psychology Of Interpersonal Relations,Fritz Heider,,,,,"2015 Reprint Of 1958 Edition. Full Facsimile Of The Original Edition. Not Reproduced With Optical Recognition Software.

A Giant Of Social Psychology, Heider Had Few Students, But His Book On Social Perception Had Many Readers, And Its Impact Continues Into The 21St Century, Having Been Cited Over 13,000 Times. In ""The Psychology Of Interpersonal Relations,"" Heider Argued That Social Perception Follows Many Of The Same Rules Of Physical Object Perception, And That The Organization Found In Object Perception Is Also Found In Social Perception. Because Biases In Object Perception Sometimes Lead To Errors (E.G., Optical Illusions), One Might Expect To Find That Biases In Social Perception Likewise Lead To Errors (E.G., Underestimating The Role Social Factors And Overestimating The Effect Of Personality And Attitudes On Behavior). Heider Also Argued That Perceptual Organization Follows The Rule Of Psychological Balance. Although Tedious To Spell Out In Completeness, The Idea Is That Positive And Negative Sentiments Need To Be Represented In Ways That Minimize Ambivalence And Maximize A Simple, Straightforward Affective Representation Of The Person. He Writes ""To Conceive Of A Person As Having Positive And Negative Traits Requires A More Sophisticated View; It Requires A Differentiation Of The Representation Of The Person Into Subparts That Are Of Unlike Value (1958, P. 182)."" But The Most Influential Idea In ""The Psychology Of Interpersonal Relations"" Is The Notion Of How People See The Causes Of Behavior, And The Explanations They Make For It-What Heider Called ""Attributions.""

"Brain, Mind, And Medicine",Stewart Wolf,,,,,"Charles Richet Was One Of The Most Remarkable Figures In The History Of Medical Science. He Is Best Known For His Work On The Body'S Immune Reactions To Foreign Substances For Which He Won The Nobel Prize In Medicine In 1913. Richet Was Also A Poet, Playwright, Historian, Bibliographer, Political Activist, Classical Scholar, And Pioneer In Aircraft Design. Brain, Mind, And Medicine Is The First Major Biography Of Richet In Any Language. Wolf Brilliantly Situates Richet'S Work In The Intellectual Currents Of Europe During The Latter Half Of The Nineteenth And Early Twentieth Century. Richet'S Early Fame Rests Largely On His Discovery Of Anaphylaxis, A Hypersensitive, Potentially Fatal Reaction To The Injection Of Foreign Proteins. In Linking Such Hypersensitivity To The Body'S Self-Protective Capacities, His Work Contributed To The Unraveling Of The Mystery Of Immunity Conferred By Vaccination And Inoculation, But Most Important, He Recognized The Role Of The Brain In Regulating The Immune System. Richet Was A Contemporary Of Wilhelm Wundt And William James. Together With Richet, They Considered Psychology To Be An Aspect Of Physiology Governed By Biological Laws. But While James And Wundt Considered Consciousness As A Process Influenced By Experience Without Much Reference To Neural Structures, Richet'S Focus Was On The Brain Itself As Shaped By Genetics And Experience And Serving As The Organ Of The Mind. Brain, Mind, And Medicine Illuminates A Significant Chapter In Scientific And Cultural History.

The History Of The Psychoanalytic Movement,Sigmund Freud,,,,,"Excerpt From The History Of The Psychoanalytic Movement If In What Follows I Bring Any Contribution To The History Of The Psychoanalytic Movement Nobody Must Be Surprised At The Subjective Nature Of This Paper, Nor At The Role Which Falls To Me Therein. For Psychoanalysis Is My Creation; For Ten Years I Was The Only One Occupied With It, And All The Annoyance Which This New Subject Caused Among My Contemporaries Has Been Hurled Upon My Head In The Form Of Criticism. Even Today, When I Am No Longer The Only Psychoanalyst, I Feel Myself Justified In Assuming That None Can Know Better Than Myself What Psychoanalysis Is, Wherein It Differs From Other Methods Of Investigating The Psychic Life, What Its Name Should Cover, Or What Might Better Be Designated As Some Thing Else. In The Year 1909, When I Was First Privileged To Speak Publicly On Psychoanalysis In An American University, Fired By This Momentous Occasion For My Endeavors, I Declared That It Was Not Myself Who Brought Psychoanalysis Into Existence. I Said That It Was Josef Breuer, Who Had Merited This Honor At A Time When I Was A Student And Busy Working For My Examinations (188O-1882). Since Then, Well-Intentioned Friends Have Frequently Repeated That I Then Expressed My Gratitude Out Of All Due Proportion. They Considered That, As On Previous Occasions, I Should Have Dignified Breuer'S ""Cathartic Procedure"" As Merely Preliminary To Psycho Analysis, And Should Have Claimed That Psychoanalysis Itself Only Began With My Rejection Of The Hypnotic Technique And My Introduction Of Free Association.

Freud In The Pampas,Mariano Ben Plotkin,,,,,"This Is A Fascinating History Of How Psychoanalysis Became An Essential Element Of Contemporary Argentine Culture--In The Media, In Politics, And In Daily Private Lives. The Book Reveals The Unique Conditions And Complex Historical Process That Made Possible The Diffusion, Acceptance, And Popularization Of Psychoanalysis In Argentina, Which Has The Highest Number Of Psychoanalysts Per Capita In The World. It Shows Why The Intellectual Trajectory Of The Psychoanalytic Movement Was Different In Argentina Than In Either The United States Or Europe And How Argentine Culture Both Fostered And Was Shaped By Its Influence. The Book Starts With A Description Of The Argentine Medical And Intellectual Establishments Reception Of Psychoanalysis, And The Subsequent Founding Of The Argentine Psychoanalytic Association In 1942. It Then Broadens To Describe The Emergence Of A ""Psy Culture In The 1960S, Tracing Its Origins To A Complex Combination Of Social, Economic, Political, And Cultural Factors. The Author Then Analyzes The Role Of ""Diffusers Of Psychoanalysis In Argentina--Both Those Who Were Part Of The Psychoanalytic Establishment And Those Who Were Not. The Book Goes On To Discuss Specific Areas Of Reception And Diffusion Of Psychoanalytic Thought: Its Acceptance By Progressive Sectors Of The Psychiatric Profession; The Impact Of The Psychoanalytically Oriented Program In Psychology At The University Of Buenos Aires; And The Incorporation Of Psychoanalysis Into The Theoretical Artillery Of The Influential Left Of The 1960S And 1970S.

Psychoanalytic Method In Motion,Richard Tuch,,,,,"Psychoanalytic Method In Motion Identifies And Examines Varied Controversies About How Psychoanalysts Believe Treatment Should Best Be Conducted. Irrespective Of Their Particular School Of Thought, Every Analyst Builds Up A Repertoire Of His Favored Ways Of Working, Which Some Analysts Come To See As The Most Efficacious Approach To Treatment Available. While Such Differences Of Opinion Are Unsettling, And May Even Threaten To Tear The Field Asunder, This Book Sees These Differences As Benefitting Psychoanalysis By Improving The Ways In Which Psychoanalysts And Psychoanalytic Psychotherapists Practice. In This Book, Richard Tuch Covers The Waterfront By Examining Controversies That Further The Field By Raising Questions That Help Evolve The Treatment, Challenging Every Analyst To Re-Think What They Are Doing In The Consulting Room...And Why. Some Of The Chief Controversies Explored Include: The Enactment Debate—Unparalleled Tool Or Regrettable Error? Whether Analysts Can Truly Be ""Objective""—Whatever That Means The Advantages And Disadvantages Arising From The Analyst’S Use Of Authority The Ways In Which Theory Influences The Analyst’S Search For Data—Blinding Him To Evidence He Implicitly Discards As Irrelevant Whether Any Given Treatment Approach Is More Efficacious Than Others, As Some Analysts Claim The Legitimacy Of Psychoanalysis Itself—Whether It Can Truly Be Considered Scientific Whether Certain Methods Of Supervision Are More Effective Than Others Whether Free Association Can Be Considered Therapeutic In And Of Itself The Extent To Which An Analyst Preferred Clinical Theory Is A Product Of His Personality Drawing On Ideas From A Range Of Different Analytic Perspectives, This Book Is An Essential And Accessibly Written Guide To Working Towards Best Practice In The Analytic Setting.

The Social Edges Of Psychoanalysis,Neil J. Smelser,,,,,"For Several Decades The Writings Of Sociologist Neil J. Smelser Have Won Him A Vast And Admiring Audience Across Several Disciplines. Best Known For His Work On Social Movements, Economic Sociology, And British Social History, Smelser'S Psychoanalytic Writings Are Less Familiar To His Readers. In Fact, Many People Are Completely Unaware Of Smelser'S Formal Psychoanalytic Training And Ongoing Counseling Practice. With The Publication Of The Social Edges Of Psychoanalysis, Smelser'S Thought-Provoking Essays On Psychoanalytic Concepts Are Finally Brought Together In One Book. Psychoanalytic Theory Has Had An Ambivalent Relationship With Sociology, And These Essays Explore That Ambivalence, Providing Arguments About How And Why Psychoanalytic Approaches Can Deepen The Sociological Perspective. One Of Smelser'S Main Tenets Is That Human Social Behavior Always Contains Both Social-Structural And Social-Psychological Elements, And That Psychoanalytic Theory Can Bridge These Two Dimensions Of Human Social Life. Many Of The Issues Smelser Addresses—Including Interdisciplinarity, The Macro-Micro Link In Research, Masculinity And Violence, And Affirmative Action—Have Generated Considerable Scholarly Interest. This Collection Paves The Way For Further Articulation Of The Relationship Between Sociology And Psychoanalysis At A Time When Many Sociologists Are Looking For Interdisciplinary Links In Their Work. Presented With Clarity And Grace, And Free Of The Murkiness Often Found In Both Sociological And Psychoanalytic Writing, Smelser'S New Book Will Excite Reflection And Research On The Less Visible Dynamics Of Social Existence.",Univ Of California Press,314.0,English,2023-04-28,"Psychology , Movements , Psychoanalysis",9780520921375

Psychiatric Movements,,,,,,"In The Early 1970S, The Preeminence Of Psychoanalysis In The Treatment Of Mental Illness Gave Way To A Number Of Other Approaches. Yet, Rather Than Practicing In Cooperation, The Different Schools--Existentialism, Psychoanalysis, Interpersonalism, Behaviorism--Each Taught Its Own Methods, Convinced It Was The True Psychiatry. As A Result, All Too Frequently, Varieties Of Psychiatry Have Come And Gone, Wallowing In A Battle Of Sects Rather Than Progressing Toward Knowledge. In Psychiatric Movements, Leston Havens Posits That Psychiatry Must Adopt A Pluralistic Stance, For Only An Inclusive Psychiatry Can Bridge The Traditional Scientific Quest Of Medicine With A Humanistic Interest In Whole Lives, Inner States, And Relationships With Others. If For No Other Reason, From An Ethical Standpoint, The Patient Should Get The Treatment He Needs, Not The One Treatment The Doctor Dispenses.

Interactive Multiple Goal Programming,J. Spronk,,,,,"1. 1. Motivation This Book Is Based On The View-Tx)Int That Both Public And Private Decision Making, In Practice, Can Often Be Ilrproved Upon By Means Of Fonnal (Nonnative) Decision Nodels And Methods. To Sane Extent, The Validity Of This Statement Can Be Measured By The Irrpressive Number Of Su=Esses Of Disciplines As Operations Research And Management Science. Hcwever, As Witnessed By The Many Discussions In The Professional Journals In These Fields, Many Rrodels And Methods Do Not Completely Meet The Requirements Of Decision Making In Prac­ Tice. Of All Possible Origins Of These Clear Shortcomings, We Main-· Ly Focus On Only One: The Fact That Nost Of These Nodels And Methods Are Unsuitable For Decision Situations In Which Multiple And Possi­ Bly Conflicting Objectives Playa Role, Because They Are Concentra­ Ted On The (Optimal) Fulfilment Of Only One Objective. The Need To Account For Multiple Goals Was Observed Relatively Early. Hoffman [1955], While Describing 'What Seem To Be The Prin­ Cipal Areas (In Linear Prograrrrning) Where New Ideas And New Methods Are Needed' Gives An Exanple With Conflicting Goals. In This Pro­ Blem, The Assignrrent Of Relative Weights Is A Great Problem For The Planning Staff And Is 'Probably Not The Province Of The Mathemati­ Cian Engaged In Solving This Problem'.

The Modern Period,Lara Freidenfelds,,,,,"Winner, 2010 Emily Toth Award For Best Book In Women’S Studies, Popular Culture Association/American Culture Association The Modern Period Examines How And Why Americans Adopted Radically New Methods Of Managing And Thinking About Menstruation During The Twentieth Century. In The Early Twentieth Century Women Typically Used Homemade Cloth ""Diapers"" To Absorb Menstrual Blood, Avoided Chills During Their Periods To Protect Their Health, And Counted Themselves Lucky If They Knew Something About Menstruation Before Menarche. New Expectations At School, At Play, And In The Workplace, However, Made These Menstrual Traditions Problematic, And Middle-Class Women Quickly Sought New Information And Products That Would Make Their Monthly Periods Less Disruptive To Everyday Life. Lara Freidenfelds Traces This Cultural Shift, Showing How Americans Reframed Their Thinking About Menstruation. She Explains How Women And Men Collaborated With Sex Educators, Menstrual Product Manufacturers, Advertisers, Physical Education Teachers, And Doctors To Create A Modern Understanding Of Menstruation. Excerpts From Seventy-Five Interviews—Accounts By Turns Funny And Moving—Help Readers To Identify With The Experiences Of The Ordinary People Who Engineered These Changes.

Shakespeare'S Hand,Jonathan Goldberg,,,,,"Over The Past Fifteen Years, Jonathan Goldberg'S Wide-Ranging Essays Have Been Among The Most Sophisticated, Influential, And Controversial Writing About Shakespeare. He Challenges The Critical Orthodoxy, Provoking Scholars To Reassess Both Their Own Assumptions And Those Underpinning The Field Of Shakespeare Studies. Collected In One Volume For The First Time, These Essays Offer A Sustained, Energetic, And Rigorous Examination Of Issues Of Gender And Sexuality That Pervade Shakespeare'S Plays, As Well As A Road Map Of The Shifts During The Past Two Decades In Our Understanding Of English Literature'S Most Canonical Figure. Central To These Essays Are Concerns About Textuality As Considered From A Number Of Vantage Points, Including Deconstructionist, Psychoanalytic, And Historicist. Goldberg Studies Most Of Shakespeare'S Plays, Giving Particular Emphasis To Henry Iv, Parts 1 And 2, And To Romeo And Juliet; He Focuses Throughout On The Relationship Between The Text As Material Object And The Reality Created Or Reflected By That Text. Among The Issues He Considers Are The Textual Instability Of Shakespeare'S Plays And The Historical Instabilities Of Gender And Sexuality Depicted In Those Plays, The Construction Of Gender And The Dehumanization Implicit In Treating Characters As A Textual Production, The Function Of Letters And Other Documents Within The Shakespearean Texts, And The Correlation Of Sexual Politics And Textual Desire. Tracing A Path From Characters In The Scriptive Sense To Their Embodiment In Characters Marked By Gender And Sexuality, Shakespeare'S Hand Provides A Brilliant Set Of Inquiries Into The Production, Critical Reception, And Conditions Of Shakespearean Texts.",U Of Minnesota Press,398.0,English,2003,"Drama , Shakespeare",9780816641499

And On-Stage A Tenor Is Blowing His Heart Out, A Searching, Jagged Saxophone Journey Played Out Against A Moody, Walking Bass And The Swish Of A Drummer'S Brushes. To A Great Many Listeners--From African American Aficionados Of The Period To A Whole New Group Of Fans Today--This Is The Very Embodiment Of Jazz. It Is Also Quintessential Hard Bop. In This, The First Thorough Study Of The Subject, Jazz Expert And Enthusiast David H. Rosenthal Vividly Examines The Roots, Traditions, Explorations And Permutations, Personalities And Recordings Of A Climactic Period In Jazz History. Beginning With Hard Bop'S Origins As An Amalgam Of Bebop And R&B, Rosenthal Narrates The Growth Of A Movement That Embraced The Heavy Beat And Bluesy Phrasing Of Such Popular Artists As Horace Silver And Cannonball Adderley; The Stark, Astringent, Tormented Music Of Saxophonists Jackie Mclean And Tina Brooks; The Gentler, More Lyrical Contributions Of Trumpeter Art Farmer, Pianists Hank Jones And Tommy Flanagan, Composers Benny Golson And Gigi Gryce; And Such Consciously Experimental And Truly One-Of-A-Kind Players And Composers As Andrew Hill, Sonny Rollins, John Coltrane, Thelonious Monk, And Charles Mingus. Hard Bop Welcomed All Influences--Whether Gospel, The Blues, Latin Rhythms, Or Debussy And Ravel--Into Its Astonishingly Creative, Hard-Swinging Orbit. Although Its Emphasis On Expression And Downright ""Badness"" Over Technical Virtuosity Was Unappreciated By Critics, Hard Bop Was The Music Of Black Neighborhoods And The Last Jazz Movement To Attract The Most Talented Young Black Musicians. Fortunately, Records Were There To Catch It All. The Years Between 1955 And 1965 Are Unrivaled In Jazz History For The Number Of Milestones On Vinyl. Miles Davis'S Kind Of Blue, Charles Mingus'S Mingus Ah Um, Thelonious Monk'S Brilliant Corners, Horace Silver'S Further Explorations--Rosenthal Gives A Perceptive Cut-By-Cut Analysis Of These And Other Jazz Masterpieces, Supplying An Essential Discography As Well.

"Gaslighting, The Double Whammy, Interrogation And Other Methods Of Covert Control In Psychotherapy And Analysis",Theodore L. Dorpat,,,,,"In Treatment, The Psychotherapist Is In A Position Of Power. Often, This Power Is Unintentionally Abused. While Trying To Embody A Compassionate Concern For Patients, Therapists Use Accepted Techniques That Can Inadvertently Lead To Control, Indoctrination, And Therapeutic Failure. Contrary To The Stated Tradition And Values Of Psychotherapy, They Subtly Coerce Patients Rather Than Respect And Genuinely Help Them. The More Gross Kinds Of Patient Abuse, Deliberate Ones Such As Sexual And Financial Exploitation, Are Expressly Forbidden By Professional Organizations. However, There Are No Regulations Discouraging The More Covert Forms Of Manipulation, Which Are Not Even Considered Exploitative By Many Clinicians. In This Book, Noted Psychiatrist Theo. L. Dorpat Strongly Disagrees. Using A Contemporary Interactional Perspective Dorpat Demonstrates The Destructive Potential Of Manipulation And Indoctrination In Treatment.

Generative Trance,Stephen Gilligan,,,,,"This Book Describes An Entirely New Way Of Conducting Hypnotherapeutic Interventions - Stephen Gilligan'S Generative Trance. The First Generation Of Trance Work, The Traditional Hypnosis That Still Holds Sway In Most Places, Considers That Both The Conscious Mind And The Unconscious Mind Of The Client Are, To Put It Bluntly, Idiots. So Trance Work Involves First 'Knocking Out' The Conscious Mind And Then Talking To The Unconscious Mind Like A 2-Year Old That Needs To Be Told How To Behave. Milton Erickson Created The Second Generation Of Trance Work. He Approached The Unconscious As Having Creative Wisdom And Each Person As Extraordinarily Unique. Thus, Rather Than Trying To Programme The Unconscious With New Instructions, Erickson Saw Trance As An Experiential Learning State Where A Person'S Own Creative Unconscious Could Generate Healing And Transformation. At The Same Time Erickson, For The Most Part, Carried The Same Low Opinion Of The Conscious Mind. Thus, Ericksonian Hypnosis Looks To Bypass The Conscious Mind With Indirect Suggestions And Dissociation And Depotentiate It With Confusion Techniques.",Crown House Publishing,355.0,English,2012-10-25,Psychology,9781845907839

From Civil Strife To Peace Building,Hany Besada,,,,,"From Civil Strife To Peace Building Examines Peace-Building Efforts In The Fragile West African States Of Sierra Leone, Liberia, And Côte D’Ivoire, With A Focus On The Role Of The Private Sector In Leading The Reconstruction Initiatives. Given That Aid And Debt Relief, The Traditional Remedies For Dependency And Underdevelopment, Have Not Been Effective, The Private Sector Is Increasingly Viewed As A Major Player In The Revival Of Regional Economies. Private Sector Support, However, Requires Government Intervention To Improve Investment Climates, Curb Corruption, Strengthen The Security Sector, And Reduce The Cost Of Doing Business. The Contributors Discuss Ways In Which West African Governments Can Encourage The Greater Involvement Of Business In Humanitarian Support With Incentives That Demonstrate Alignment With Business Objectives And Profit Margins, Making Humanitarian Support Simple And, More Importantly, Profitable And Sustainable For Both Local And Foreign Investors.

Ivory,Keith Somerville,,,,,"""Despite The 1989 Global Ivory Trade Ban, Poaching And Ivory Smuggling Have Not Abated. More Than Half Of Tanzania'S Elephants Have Been Killed For Their Ivory Since 2007. A Similarly Alarming Story Can Be Told Of The Herds In Northern Mozambique And Across Swathes Of Central Africa. But Why The New Upsurge? The Popular Narrative Blames A Meeting Of Two Evils -- Criminal Poaching And Terrorism. But The Answer Is Not That Simple. Since Ancient Times, Large-Scale Killing Of Elephants For Their Tusks Has Been Driven By Demand Beyond Africa'S Range States From The Egyptian Pharaohs Through The Industrialising West To The New Wealthy Business Class Of China. Elephant Hunting In Africa Is Also Governed By Human-Elephant Conflict, Traditional Hunting Practices And The Impact Of Colonial Exploitation And Criminalisation. Ivory Follows This Complex History Of The Tusk Trade In Africa, And Explains Why It Is Corruption, Crime And Politics, Rather Than Insurgency, That We Should Worry About.

The Need For Nutrients Determines Whether Wild Animals Thrive, How Populations Evolve And Decline, And How Ecological Communities Are Structured. The Nature Of Nutrition Is The First Book To Address Nutrition'S Enormously Complex Role In Biology, Both At The Level Of Individual Organisms And In Their Broader Ecological Interactions. Stephen Simpson And David Raubenheimer Provide A Comprehensive Theoretical Approach To The Analysis Of Nutrition—The Geometric Framework. They Show How It Can Help Us To Understand The Links Between Nutrition And The Biology Of Individual Animals, Including The Physiological Mechanisms That Determine The Nutritional Interactions Of The Animal With Its Environment, And The Consequences Of These Interactions In Terms Of Health, Immune Responses, And Lifespan. Simpson And Raubenheimer Explain How These Effects Translate Into The Collective Behavior Of Groups And Societies, And In Turn Influence Food Webs And The Structure Of Ecosystems. Then They Demonstrate How The Geometric Framework Can Be Used To Tackle Issues In Applied Nutrition, Such As The Problem Of Optimizing Diets For Livestock And Endangered Species, And How It Can Also Help To Address The Epidemic Of Human Obesity And Metabolic Disease. Drawing On A Wealth Of Examples From Slime Molds To Humans, The Nature Of Nutrition Has Important Applications In Ecology, Evolution, And Physiology, And Offers Promising Solutions For Human Health, Conservation, And Agriculture.",Princeton University Press,260.0,English,2012-07-22,Nature,9781400842803

The Four Books On Architecture,Andrea Palladio,,,,,"The Renaissance Architect Andrea Palladio Was One Of The Most Influential Figures That The Field Of Architecture Has Ever Produced. For Classical Architects, The Term Palladian Stands For A Vocabulary Of Architectural Forms Embodying Perfection And Beauty. Of Even Greater Significance Than Palladio'S Buildings Is His Treatise I Quattro Libri Dell'Architettura (The Four Books On Architecture), The Most Successful Architectural Treatise Of The Renaissance And One Of The Two Or Three Most Important Books In The Literature Of Architecture. First Published In Italian In 1570, It Has Been Translated Into Every Major Western Language. This Is The First English Translation Of Palladio In Over 250 Years, Making It The Only Translation Available In Modern English. Until Now, English-Language Readers Have Had To Rely Mostly On A Facsimile Of Isaac Ware'S 1738 Translation And The Eighteenth-Century Engravings Prepared For That Text. This New Translation By Robert Tavernor And Richard Schofield Contains Palladio'S Original Woodcuts, Reproduced In Facsimile And Positioned Correctly, Adjacent To The Text. The Book Also Contains A Glossary That Explains Technical Terms In Their Original Context, A Bibliography Of Recent Palladio Research, And An Introduction To Palladio And His Times. The First Book Discusses Building Materials And Techniques, As Well As The Five Orders Of Architecture: Tuscan, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian, And Composite. Palladio Describes The Characteristics Of Each Order And Illustrates Them. The Second Book Discusses Private Town Houses And Country Estates, Almost All Designed By Palladio.

Rast",,,,,"This Book Gives A Comprehensive Presentation Of Our Present Understanding Of The Earth'S Hydrological Cycle And The Problems, Consequences And Impacts That Go With This Topic. Water Is A Central Component In The Earth'S System. It Is Indispensable For Life On Earth In Its Present Form And Influences Virtually Every Aspect Of Our Planet'S Life Support System. On Relatively Short Time Scales, Atmospheric Water Vapor Interacts With The Atmospheric Circulation And Is Crucial In Forming The Earth'S Climate Zones. Water Vapor Is The Most Powerful Of The Greenhouse Gases And Serves To Enhance The Tropospheric Temperature. The Dominant Part Of Available Water On Earth Resides In The Oceans. Parts Are Locked Up In The Land Ice On Greenland And Antarctica And A Smaller Part Is Estimated To Exist As Groundwater. If All The Ice Over The Land And All The Glaciers Were To Melt, The Sea Level Would Rise By Some 80 M. In Comparison, The Total Amount Of Water Vapor In The Atmosphere Is Small; It Amounts To ~ 25 Kg/M2, Or The Equivalent Of 25 Mm Water For Each Column Of Air. Yet Atmospheric Water Vapor Is Crucial For The Earth’S Energy Balance. The Book Gives An Up To Date Presentation Of The Present Knowledge.

Environmental Politics And Liberation In Contemporary Africa,Mohamed Salih,4.0,1.0,,,"Nowadays, The Environment Looms Large In The Analysis Of Conflict In Developing Societies, And The Precise Role It Plays Is The Subject Of An Ongoing Debate. The De Bate Has Moved On From The Earlier, But Still Popular, Notions Of 'Power Struggles', 'Class Struggles' And 'Ethnic Conflicts', To A Perception Of Conflict As The Product Of Intense Group Competition For Resources. Where The State Controls The Distribu Tion Of Resources, Itself Inevitably Becomes Party To Conflicts Whose Bone Of Con Tention Is Access To State Power As The Most Efficient Means Of Gaining Access To Resources. The Resources In Question Are Social (Health, Education, Transportation, Communication, Recreation, Etc. ) And Material (Land, Water, Housing, Jobs, Con Tracts, Licenses, Permits, Etc. ). In Parts Of The World, And Especially In Africa, Di Minishing Resources And Authoritarian State Rule Exacerbate Group Competition Leading To Political Confrontation. This Is The Line I Have Followed In Analysing Conflict In The Hom Of Africa (Markakis, 1987, 1998). Mohamed Salih'S First Contribution In This Volume Is To Move The Debate A Step Beyond This Line, Which Can Be Criticized As Unduly Materialist. He Does It By Bringing Culture Into The Realm Of Resources, Not Only As A Resource In Itself, But Also As The Agency That Assigns Natural Resources Their Value.
