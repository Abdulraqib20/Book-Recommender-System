Et uforudset d\u00f8dsfald tvinger Beyah til at bo med sin far i Texas hen over sommeren, selvom hun knapt nok kender ham. Beyahs plan er at holde lav profil og lade sommeren g\u00e5 af sig selv, men hendes nye nabo Samson vender op og ned p\u00e5 det hele. P\u00e5 overfladen har Samson og Beyah intet til f\u00e6lles.

Hvad Beyah ikke ved, er at tunge skyer er p\u00e5 vej ind, og at hendes hjerte snart kommer ud i stormvejr.",

        "description": "A Novel that Stood the Test of Time \u201cBut I do know that about ten times as many people find their lives dull, and unnecessarily dull, as ever admit it; and I do believe that if we busted out and admitted it sometimes, instead of being nice and patient and loyal for sixty years, and then nice and patient and dead for the rest of eternity, why, maybe, possibly, we might make life more fun.\u201d - Sinclair Lewis, Babbitt Although it was first published in 1922, Babbitt reveals the flaws of our modern society. Are money going to make us happy? Is social status such an important aspect in our lives? Can\u2019t we just live in the moment? Asked some 90 odd years ago, these same questions haunt the Western society to this day. Can George F. Babbitt find the answer? This Xist Classics edition has been professionally formatted for e-readers with a linked table of contents. This eBook also contains a bonus book club leadership guide and discussion questions.

In this tale we hear all about his and Peter's adventures in Mr McGregor's vegetable garden, and what happens to them when they meet a cat! Even more frightening, is what happens to the two pesky bunnies when Old Mr Benjamin Bunny finds out what they have been up to! Beatrix Potter is regarded as one of the world's best-loved children's authors of all time. From her first book, The Tale of Peter Rabbit, published by Frederick Warne in 1902, she went on to create a series of stories based around animal characters including Mrs. Tiggy-winkle, Benjamin Bunny, Jemima Puddle-duck, Mr. Jeremy Fisher and Tom Kitten.",

Helen is satisfied with her existence until her brother decides to start writing books about the pleasures of country life and suddenly becomes a celebrity author. Unexpectedly he's a prominent \"literary man,\" traveling around searching for inspiration for his next book. Andrew stops helping Helen around the farm and takes her for granted. One day Roger Mifflin, a short man with a red beard, stops at her farmhouse in a horse-drawn wagon loaded with books. After his arrival, Helen does something that changes her life entirely and leaves the readers emotionally satisfied with her decision. It's a beautifully written book with incredible descriptions and a strong main character. This heartwarming book follows a simple writing style and is a must-read for book-lovers.",

His goal is to facilitate Winter's inclusion in a growing intergalactic civilization. But to do so he must bridge the gulf between his own views and those of the completely dissimilar culture that he encounters.

Deciding that CeCe, who lives in Australia, is the closest, they send her to investigate with her partner, Chrissie. So begins a race against time to identify the Missing Sister, so she can join her sisters on The Titan to lay a wreath at a spot on the Aegean Sea where Ally last saw Pa Salt's boat. It's a race that takes them across the globe, as Mary McDougal, the woman who has the emerald ring that can confirm for certain if her daughter, Mary-Kate, is the Missing Sister, has embarked on a world tour after the death of her husband. As each sister takes their turn to trace her in New Zealand, Canada, England, France and Ireland, the elusive Mary manages to slip through their fingers, and it seems that she does not want to be found...",

It is set in motion one spring morning in New York City when a seventeen-year-old student wakes up feeling vaguely ill. She seems to be coming down with a cold. Hours later she is having violent seizures, blood is pouring out of her nose, and she has begun a hideous process of self-cannibalization. Soon, other gruesome deaths of a similar nature have been discovered, and the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta sends a forensic pathologist. an expert in epidemiology, to investigate. What she finds precipitates a federal crisis. The details of this story are fictional, but they are based on a scrupulously thorough inquiry into the history of biological weapons and their use by civilian and military terrorists. \"The creation of advanced biological weapons using methods of genetic engineering and biotechnology is sometimes known as 'black biology,'\" Richard Preston writes. The extent to which the products of black biology are available nearly everywhere in the world is shocking. Preston's sources for his story include members of the FBI and the United States military, public health officials, intelligence officers in foreign governments, and scientists who have been involved in the development and testing of strategic bioweapons. The stories of what they have seen and what they expect to happen and how they plan to deal with it are chilling. The Cobra Eventis not science fiction. It is a dramatic, heart-stopping account of a very real threat, told with the skill and authority that made Richard Preston'sThe Hot Zonean internationally acclaimed bestseller.",

But what do these disparate works have in common, other than their temporal setting? And what can the imagination of the near future tell us about where we live now? The Near Future in 21st Century Fiction ranges across novels and films to reveal how our contemporary near future splits between two divergent paths. One seeks to retreat from climate change and the disruption it threatens to affluent lifestyles; the other tries to imagine new forms of community, and radical change, but struggles to locate a genre adequate to the task. It in this struggle, however, that we begin to glimpse the outlines of an emergent near future form: a revolution fit for the Anthropocene.",

        "description": "With Comeuppance, William Flesch delivers the freshest, most generous thinking about the novel since Walter Benjamin wrote on the storyteller and Wayne C. Booth on the rhetoric of fiction. In clear and engaging prose, Flesch integrates evolutionary psychology into literary studies, creating a new theory of fiction in which form and content flawlessly intermesh. Fiction, Flesch contends, gives us our most powerful way of making sense of the social world. Comeuppance begins with an exploration of the appeal of gossip and ends with an account of how we can think about characters and care about them as much as about persons we know to be real. We praise a storyteller who contrives a happy or at least an appropriate ending, and fault the writer who refuses us one. Flesch uses Darwinian theory to show how fiction satisfies our desire to see the good vindicated and the wicked get their comeuppance. He conveys the danger and excitement of reading fiction with nimble intelligence and provides wide reference to stories both familiar and little known. Flesch has given us a book that is sure to claim a central place in the discussion of literature and the humanities.",

        "description": "A century and a half after the publication of Origin of Species, evolutionary thinking has expanded beyond the field of biology to include virtually all human-related subjects\u2014anthropology, archeology, psychology, economics, religion, morality, politics, culture, and art. Now a distinguished scholar offers the first comprehensive account of the evolutionary origins of art and storytelling. Brian Boyd explains why we tell stories, how our minds are shaped to understand them, and what difference an evolutionary understanding of human nature makes to stories we love. Art is a specifically human adaptation, Boyd argues. It offers tangible advantages for human survival, and it derives from play, itself an adaptation widespread among more intelligent animals. More particularly, our fondness for storytelling has sharpened social cognition, encouraged cooperation, and fostered creativity. After considering art as adaptation, Boyd examines Homer\u2019s Odyssey and Dr. Seuss\u2019s Horton Hears a Who! demonstrating how an evolutionary lens can offer new understanding and appreciation of specific works. What triggers our emotional engagement with these works? What patterns facilitate our responses? The need to hold an audience\u2019s attention, Boyd underscores, is the fundamental problem facing all storytellers. Enduring artists arrive at solutions that appeal to cognitive universals: an insight out of step with contemporary criticism, which obscures both the individual and universal. Published for the bicentenary of Darwin\u2019s birth and the 150th anniversary of the publication of Origin of Species, Boyd\u2019s study embraces a Darwinian view of human nature and art, and offers a credo for a new humanism.",

        "description": "Science fiction explores the wonderful, baffling and wildly entertaining aspects of a universe unimaginably old and vast, and with a future even more immense. It reaches into that endless cosmos with the tools of rational investigation and storytelling. At the core of both science and science fiction is the engaged human mind--a consciousness that sees and feels and thinks and loves. But what is this mind, this aware and self-aware consciousness that seems unlike anything else we experience? What makes consciousness the Hard Problem of philosophy, still unsolved after millennia of probing? This book looks into the heart of this mystery - at the science and philosophy of consciousness and at many inspiring fictional examples - and finds strange, challenging answers. The book's content and entertaining style will appeal equally to science fiction enthusiasts and scholars, including cognitive and neuroscientists, as well as philosophers of mind. It is a refreshing romp through the science and science fiction of consciousness.",

        "description": "Personal genome testing, gene editing for life-threatening diseases, synthetic life: once the stuff of science fiction, twentieth- and twenty-first-century advancements blur the lines between scientific narrative and scientific fact. This examination of bioengineering in popular and literary culture shows that the influence of science on science fiction is more reciprocal than we might expect. Looking closely at the work of Margaret Atwood, Richard Powers, and other authors, as well as at film, comics, and serial television such as Orphan Black, Everett Hamner shows how the genome age is transforming both the most commercial and the most sophisticated stories we tell about the core of human personhood. As sublime technologies garner public awareness beyond the genre fiction shelves, they inspire new literary categories like \u201cslipstream\u201d and shape new definitions of the human, the animal, the natural, and the artificial. In turn, what we learn of bioengineering via popular and literary culture prepares the way for its official adoption or restriction\u2014and for additional representations. By imagining the connections between emergent gene testing and editing capacities and long-standing conversations about freedom and determinism, these stories help build a cultural zeitgeist with a sharper, more balanced vision of predisposed agency. A compelling exploration of the interrelationships among science, popular culture, and self, Editing the Soul sheds vital light on what the genome age means to us, and what\u2019s to come.",

        "description": "*Finalist for the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Critics Circle Award* *A New York Times Notable Book* *Winner of the Texas Book Award and the Oklahoma Book Award* This New York Times bestseller and stunning historical account of the forty-year battle between Comanche Indians and white settlers for control of the American West \u201cis nothing short of a revelation\u2026will leave dust and blood on your jeans\u201d (The New York Times Book Review). Empire of the Summer Moon spans two astonishing stories. The first traces the rise and fall of the Comanches, the most powerful Indian tribe in American history. The second entails one of the most remarkable narratives ever to come out of the Old West: the epic saga of the pioneer woman Cynthia Ann Parker and her mixed-blood son Quanah, who became the last and greatest chief of the Comanches. Although readers may be more familiar with the tribal names Apache and Sioux, it was in fact the legendary fighting ability of the Comanches that determined when the American West opened up. Comanche boys became adept bareback riders by age six; full Comanche braves were considered the best horsemen who ever rode. They were so masterful at war and so skillful with their arrows and lances that they stopped the northern drive of colonial Spain from Mexico and halted the French expansion westward from Louisiana. White settlers arriving in Texas from the eastern United States were surprised to find the frontier being rolled backward by Comanches incensed by the invasion of their tribal lands. The war with the Comanches lasted four decades, in effect holding up the development of the new American nation. Gwynne\u2019s exhilarating account delivers a sweeping narrative that encompasses Spanish colonialism, the Civil War, the destruction of the buffalo herds, and the arrival of the railroads, and the amazing story of Cynthia Ann Parker and her son Quanah\u2014a historical feast for anyone interested in how the United States came into being. Hailed by critics, S. C. Gwynne\u2019s account of these events is meticulously researched, intellectually provocative, and, above all, thrillingly told. Empire of the Summer Moon announces him as a major new writer of American history.",

        "description": "The life of Nathuram Godse, the man who shot Gandhi Dhirendra Jha's deeply researched history places Nathuram Godse's life as the juncture of the dangerous fault lines in contemporary India: the quest for independence and the rise of Hindu nationalism. On a wintry Delhi evening on 30 January 1948, Nathuram Godse shot Gandhi at point-blank range, forever silencing the man who had delivered independence to his nation. Godse\u2019s journey to this moment of international notoriety from small towns in western India is, by turns, both riveting and wrenching. Drawing from previously unpublished archival material, Jha challenges the standard account of Gandhi\u2019s assassination, and offers a stunning view on the making of independent India. Born to Brahmin parents, Godse started off as a child mystic. However, success eluded him. The caste system placed him at the top of society but the turbulent times meant that he soon became a disaffected youth, desperately seeking a position in the infant nation. In such confusing times, Godse was one of hundreds, and later thousands, of young Indian men to be steered into the sheltering fold of early Hindutva, Indian nationalism. His association with early formations of the RSS and far-right thinkers such as Sarvakar proves that he was not working alone. Today he is considered to be a patriotic hero by many for his act of bravery, despite being found guilty in court and executed in 1949.",

Of crucial significance was the invention of the university around 1200, within which reason was institutionalized and where it became a deeply embedded, permanent feature of Western thought and culture. It is therefore appropriate to speak of an Age of Reason in the Middle Ages, and to view it as a forerunner and herald of the Age of Reason that was to come in the seventeenth century. The object of this study is twofold: to describe how reason was manifested in the curriculum of medieval universities, especially in the subjects of logic, natural philosophy and theology; and to explain how the Middle Ages acquired an undeserved reputation as an age of superstition, barbarism, and unreason.",

        "description": "\"The publication of Richard Burridge's What Are the Gospels? in 1992 inaugurated a transformation in Gospel studies by overturning the previous consensus about Gospel uniqueness. Burridge argued convincingly for an understanding of the Gospels as biographies, a ubiquitous genre in the Graeco-Roman world. To establish this claim, Burridge compared each of the four canonical Gospels to the many extant Graeco-Roman biographies. Drawing on insights from literary theory, he demonstrated that the previously widespread view of the Gospels as unique compositions was false. Burridge went on to discuss what a properly \"biographical\" perspective might mean for Gospel interpretation, which was amply demonstrated in the revised second edition reflecting on how his view had become the new consensus. This third, twenty-fifth anniversary edition not only celebrates the continuing influence of What Are the Gospels?, but also features a major new contribution in which Burridge analyzes recent debates and scholarship about the Gospels. Burridge both answers his critics and reflects upon the new directions now being taken by those who accept the biographical approach. This new edition also features as an appendix a significant article in which he tackles the related problem of the genre of Acts. A proven book with lasting staying power, What Are the Gospels? is not only still as relevant and instructive as it was when first published, but will also doubtlessly inspire new research and scholarship in the years ahead.\"-- Provided by publisher.",

        "description": "This book provides an analysis of the social representations of leading self-help genres, including neurolinguistic programming, cognitive self-help therapy, mindfulness, self-management, self-esteem, self-leadership and self-control. Exploring the globalised therapeutic culture of today, the book argues that psychology as 'science' is often abandoned to aid the individual pursuit for self-realization and self-optimization. Opposing the view that self-help culture is external to psychology, Madsen argues that it is firmly embedded within psychology, playing an important role in people's lives. Each chapter traces and critically interprets a range of self-help philosophies and techniques, examining the claims of self-help literature to represent the most innovative psychological, medical or neurobiological research. Discussing each genre in turn, chapters examine key research alongside self-help literature to explore the effectiveness and impact of leading self-help genres in various social contexts and environments. The book offers a contemporary critical overview of issues concerning self-help, combining critical psychology with the theory of social representation to provide a broad perspective on self-help as a valid psychology. Optimizing the Self will be of interest to academics, researchers and postgraduate students in the fields of social representation, critical and cultural psychology and theory, clinical psychology, and the sociology of culture and science. The book will also be of use to critical and cultural psychologists and theorists, as well as clinical psychologists.",

        "description": "A world full of self-help books and we still need help. One self-help book followed by another, like cars rolling off an assembly line. And so the cycle of reading continues. We've become addicted to self-help books. What's gone wrong? As we grab the next self-help book, barely having finished the last, we've assumed the genre reflects and satisfies our need for self-fulfilment. And yet, it's always playing catch-up. I examine how the self-help genre is embedded in a dominant ideological current running through ever-increasing parts of our culture. The individual is the site where all the fixing work takes place. Single answers. Easy fixes. Single individuals. Through detailed analysis of the mundane practices of everyday life, I show that there is another ideology, operating in tandem but concealed because of its 'mundaneness', through which we're finding ourselves. What we crave is to engage in the shared production of our lives. We want to be like other people. The self-help book genre is preventing us from being genuine individuals. We must place the individual back in the social. I pursue this analysis using critical thinking; I recommend that you follow my lead.",

        "description": "This anthology offers a unique collection of contributions focusing on the discussion about the so-called dual-process theories within the field of moral psychology. In general, dual-process theories state that in cognitive systems, two sorts of processes can be differentiated: an affective, associative process and an analytical, rule-based process. This distinction recently entered the debate on the relationship between intuitive and rational approaches to explaining the phenomenon of moral judgment. The increasing interest in these theories raises questions concerning their general impact on social contexts. The anthology aims at presenting stepping-stones of an analysis of the merits and drawbacks of this development. For that purpose, the authors discuss general questions concerning the relationship between ethics and empirical sciences, methodological questions, reassessments of established terminology and societal implications of dual-process theories in moral psychology.",

The focus on practice with diverse populations and the emphasis of ?anti-oppressive? practice have highlighted elements of the worker's relationship to their clients. The objective of this book is threefold: 1. To explore the adequacy of the concept ?use of self? for clinical practice. 2. To provide grounded accounts of practitioner's use of self in critical practice approaches. 3. To broaden the scope of the concept of critical use of self to fields of service where it is under-theorized, for example, community work, addictions, and corrections.",

After Adam and Eve are expelled from the Garden of Eden, Satan and the fallen angels stay on earth to lead people astray. But when God sends Jesus, the promised savior, to earth, Satan prepares himself for battle. As an adult, Jesus goes into the wilderness to gain strength and courage. He fasts for 40 days and nights, after which Satan tempts him with food, power, and riches. But Jesus refuses all these things, and Satan is defeated by the glory of God. This is an unabridged version of Milton's classic work, which was first published in England in 1671.",

        "description": "First published in Spain in the summer of 1929, Concerning the Angels (Sobre los angeles) is the great Spanish poet Rafael Alberti's masterpiece, on a par with T.S. Eliot's The Waste Land, Pablo Neruda's Residencia en la tierra, and Federico Garcia Lorca's Poeta en Nueva York. It marks a major departure from the light-hearted tone of the poet's earlier verse, which was notably influence by Andalusian folksong. This bilingual text is at once intensely imaginative and intimately realistic, a lyrical illumination of the poet's \"dark night of the soul.\" Rafael Alberti, born in 1902, is the last surviving member of the so-called Generation of 1927 that included such notable Spanish poets Federico Garcia Lorca, Vincente Alexandre, Pedro Salinas, Jorge Guillen, and Luis Cernuda. Christopher Sawyer-Laucanno lives in Massachusetts and teaches in the program in Writing and Humanistic Studies at MIT.",

Ibsen er verdensber\u00f8mt for skuespil som \"Et dukkehjem\", \"Peer Gynt\" og \"Hedda Gabler\", men producerede i alt over tyve dramaer, der stadig opf\u00f8res p\u00e5 teatre over hele verden.",

        "description": "First published in 1819, \"Don Juan\" is often acknowledged as one of Lord Byron's greatest poetic works. An epic poem, comprised of seventeen cantos that Byron continued to work on and expand until his death, \"Don Juan\" follows the adventures of the famous Spanish libertine and reflects upon many of the romantic and personal experiences that are universal to all mankind. From a forbidden love affair in Spain, to exile in Italy, from being shipwrecked in Greece, to being kept in slavery in Russia, Don Juan's adventures provide Byron with an exquisite framework of high drama to discuss, and often mock, Western societies. Full of coarse humor and extreme satire, Byron's poem was instantly famous and controversial upon its first publication. Byron turns many of the classic aspects of Don Juan's story on their head, making the famous womanizer instead into someone easily seduced and manipulated by women. Interwoven in this innovative work are Byron's thoughts on such topics as social convention, war, and human nature, with a surprising vindication of natural man's gracious and ignoble impulses. \"Don Juan\" endures as an entertaining, elaborate, and memorable poetic criticism of man's many foibles.

        "description": "Marcel Duchamp once asked whether it is possible to make something that is not a work of art. This question returns over and over in modernist culture, where there are no longer any authoritative criteria for what can be identified (or excluded) as a work of art. As William Carlos Williams says, A poem can be made of anything, even newspaper clippings.At this point, art turns into philosophy, all art is now conceptual art, and the manifesto becomes the distinctive genre of modernism. This book takes seriously this transformation of art into philosophy, focusing upon the systematic interest that so many European philosophers take in modernism. Among the philosophers Gerald Bruns discusses are Theodor W. Adorno, Maurice Blanchot, Arthur Danto, Stanley Cavell, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Michel Foucault, Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, Jacques Derrida, Jean-Franois Lyotard, Jean-Luc Nancy, Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe, and Emmanuel Levinas.As Bruns demonstrates, the difficulty of much modern and contemporary poetry can be summarized in the idea that a poem is made of words, not of any of the things that we use words to produce: meanings, concepts, propositions, narratives, or expressions of feeling. Many modernist poets have argued that in poetry language is no longer a form of mediation but a reality to be explored and experienced in its own right. But what sort of experience, philosophically, might this be? The problem of the materiality or hermetic character of poetic language inevitably leads to questions of how philosophy itself is to be written and what sort of communitydefines the work of art-or, for that matter, the work of philosophy.In this provocative study, Bruns answers that the culture of modernism is a kind of anarchist community, where the work of art is apt to be as much an event or experience-or, indeed, an alternative form of life-as a formal object. In modern writing, philosophy and poetry fold into one another. In this book, Bruns helps us to see how.",

Henry Fielding (1707 \u2013 1754) was an English novelist and dramatist known for his rich earthy humour and satirical prowess, and as for being the author of the famous novel Tom Jones. The chapters of this book include: 'Of Writing Lives in General, and Particularly of Pamela with a Word By the Bye of Colley Cibber and Others'; 'Of Mr. Joseph Andrews, His Birth, Parentage, Education, and Great Endowments, With a Word or Two Concerning Ancestors'; 'Or Mr. Abraham Adams the Curate, Mrs. Slipslop the Chambermaid, and Others', et cetera. This antiquarian volume is being republished now complete with a new biography of the author.",

Schulz's cartooning has never been more expressive, and his sense of humor never more unencumbered by formula or tradition. In this volume, Charlie Brown gets caught up in a fake celebrity autographs racket, Rerun gets accused of sexual harassment, the infamous \"Crybaby\" Boobie returns, Snoopy's brothers go on a quest to find Mickey Mouse, Snoopy gets his driver's license, Rerun continues to pursue the underground arts, Linus starts his own church of Great Pumpkin believers and is declared a false prophet, and other surprises that make these last few years of Peanuts ripe for reconsideration. This is the 24th volume (of 25) of the bestselling series collecting every single one of the 18,000-plus strips created by Schulz from 1950-2000.",

        "description": "Public speaking can be terrifying. For David Nihill, the idea of standing in front of an audience was scarier than cliff jumping into a thorny pit of spiders and mothers-in-law. Without a parachute or advanced weaponry. Something had to change. In what doesn't sound like the best plan ever, David decided to overcome his fears by pretending to be an accomplished comedian called \"Irish Dave\" for one full year, crashing as many comedy clubs, festivals, and shows as possible. One part of the plan was at least logical: he was already Irish and already called Dave. In one year, David went from being deathly afraid of public speaking to hosting a business conference, regularly performing stand-up comedy and winning storytelling competitions in front of packed houses. And he did it by learning from some of the best public speakers in the world: stand-up comedians. Do You Talk Funny?: 7 Comedy Habits to Become a Better (and Funnier) Public Speaker shows how the key principles of stand-up comedy can be applied to your speaking engagements and presentations to make you funnier, more interesting, and better looking. (Or at least two of the three.) Whether you are preparing for a business presentation, giving a wedding toast, defending your thesis, raising money from investors, or simply want to take on something you're afraid of, this book will take you from sweaty to stage-ready. You'll learn how to: - Craft a story and content that your audience will want to listen to - Find the funniest parts of your material and how to get to them faster - Deal with stage fright - Master the two most important parts of your performance: timing and delivery Ten percent of the author's proceeds from this book will go to Arash Bayatmakou via Help Hope Live until he is fully back on his feet and thereafter to one of the many facing the same challenges after suffering a severe spinal cord injury.",

Acquaintance, n.: A person whom we know well enough to borrow from but not well enough to lend to. Bride, n.: A woman with a great future behind her. Consult, v: To seek another's approval of a course already decided on. Ambrose Bierce's \"dictionary\" of epigrams, essays, verses, and vignettes targets the religious, the romantic, the political, and the economic, in equal measure. The book you need to define both friends and enemies, The Devil's Dictionary is also the perfect gift, showcasing Bierce's razor-sharp wit and Ralph Steadman's incisive pen to their best advantage. Ambrose Bierce (1842-1914), friend and rival of Mark Twain, was one of nineteenth-century America's most renowned satirists. A Union veteran of the Civil War, he became one of the best-known writers and journalists in the country. In 1913 he set off for Mexico, then in the throes of revolution, and was never seen again. Ralph Steadman, artist, writer, sculptor, political cartoonist, and designer of labels for vintage wines, is the author/illustrator of, most recently, the novel Doodaaa, as well as the illustrator of Lewis Carroll's Alice, George Orwell's Animal Farm, and Hunter S Thompson's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. His work appears regularly in such publications as The New Yorker, The New York Times, GQ, Esquire, and The Los Angeles Times.",

        "description": "Ranging from the imperial palaces of ancient China and the bakeries of fourteenth-century Genoa and Naples all the way to the restaurant kitchens of today, Pasta tells a story that will forever change the way you look at your next plate of vermicelli. Pasta has become a ubiquitous food, present in regional diets around the world and available in a host of shapes, sizes, textures, and tastes. Yet, although it has become a mass-produced commodity, it remains uniquely adaptable to innumerable recipes and individual creativity. Pasta: The Story of a Universal Food shows that this enormously popular food has resulted from of a lengthy process of cultural construction and widely diverse knowledge, skills, and techniques. Many myths are intertwined with the history of pasta, particularly the idea that Marco Polo brought pasta back from China and introduced it to Europe. That story, concocted in the early twentieth century by the trade magazine Macaroni Journal, is just one of many fictions umasked here. The true homelands of pasta have been China and Italy. Each gave rise to different but complementary culinary traditions that have spread throughout the world. From China has come pasta made with soft wheat flour, often served in broth with fresh vegetables, finely sliced meat, or chunks of fish or shellfish. Pastasciutta, the Italian style of pasta, is generally made with durum wheat semolina and presented in thick, tomato-based sauces. The history of these traditions, told here in fascinating detail, is interwoven with the legacies of expanding and contracting empires, the growth of mercantilist guilds and mass industrialization, and the rise of food as an art form. Whether you are interested in the origins of lasagna, the strange genesis of the Chinese pasta bing or the mystique of the most magnificent pasta of all, the timballo, this is the book for you. So dig in!",

HCIMA Book Service This book does not go into the minute details of preparation, but offers to those who practice the art of cookery - whether they be professionals chefs or managers, gourments or students - invaluable guidelines culled from more than fifty years' experience. This translation supercedes A Guide to Modern Cookery, the English version first published in 1907; it contained a fair percentage of Escoffier's recipes, but was not, unlike The Complete Guide to the Art of Modern Cookery, the comprehensive collection which contains some 2000 additional recipes. Great care had been taken to use the original metric measurements and to give accurate conversions to Imoperial and American measurements in brackets. Auguste Escoffier is unquestionably one of the greatest cooks of all time Invaluable companion for both amateur and experienced cooks",

        "description": "Curry serves up a delectable history of Indian cuisine, ranging from the imperial kitchen of the Mughal invader Babur to the smoky cookhouse of the British Raj. In this fascinating volume, the first authoritative history of Indian food, Lizzie Collingham reveals that almost every well-known Indian dish is the product of a long history of invasion and the fusion of different food traditions. We see how, with the arrival of Portuguese explorers and the Mughal horde, the cooking styles and ingredients of central Asia, Persia, and Europe came to the subcontinent, where over the next four centuries they mixed with traditional Indian food to produce the popular cuisine that we know today. Portuguese spice merchants, for example, introduced vinegar marinades and the British contributed their passion for roast meat. When these new ingredients were mixed with native spices such as cardamom and black pepper, they gave birth to such popular dishes as biryani, jalfrezi, and vindaloo. In fact, vindaloo is an adaptation of the Portuguese dish \"carne de vinho e alhos-\"-the name \"vindaloo\" a garbled pronunciation of \"vinho e alhos\"--and even \"curry\" comes from the Portuguese pronunciation of an Indian word. Finally, Collingham describes how Indian food has spread around the world, from the curry houses of London to the railway stands of Tokyo, where \"karee raisu\" (curry rice) is a favorite Japanese comfort food. We even visit Madras Mahal, the first Kosher Indian restaurant, in Manhattan. Richly spiced with colorful anecdotes and curious historical facts, and attractively designed with 34 illustrations, 5 maps, and numerous recipes, Curry is vivid, entertaining, and delicious--a feast for food lovers everywhere.",

        "description": "Inspired by the then recent unearthing of original documents and letters of Christopher Columbus, the American writer Washington Irving set about, in the 1820s, to create the first unlimited and complete account of the great explorer and his journeys. This is that account, sweeping in its scope, as intimate as a novel, as thrilling as a grand adventure story. In this, the first of two volumes, Irving introduces us to Columbus's hearings at the courts of Spain and Portugal seeking sponsorship of his journeys and follows Columbus on his first three voyages to the New World. As shipwrecks and mutinies, strange natives and displeased monarchs dog his endeavors, Columbus perseveres through all. With a dedication to historical accuracy combined with a flair for engaging storytelling, Irving bestows upon us one of the classic works of history of the Age of Exploration. WASHINGTON IRVING (1783-1859) was born in New York City to Scottish immigrant parents. Considered by some the \"Father of American Literature,\" Irving is best known for his short stories, including \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\" and \"Rip Van Winkle,\" but he also produced an extensive bibliography of essays, poems, travel books, and biographies.",

The histories of Japan, Okinawa and the entire Pacific region are crucially intertwined; therefore the review of this fascinating chain of islands is crucial to understanding all of East Asia. Few people can point to Okinawa on a map, yet this tiny island sitting between China and Japan is a hub for international affairs. The island was, and continues to be, one of the most crucial Asian nerve centers in all U.S. strategic defense. Ninety percent of all U.S. military forces in Japan are located on Okinawa, and more than 500,000 military personnel and their families have lived there. In Okinawa: The History of an Island People, noted Eastern affairs specialist George Kerr recounts the fascinating history of the island and its environs, from 1314 A.D. to the late twentieth century. First published in 1958, this edition features an introduction and appendix by Okinawa history scholar Mitsugu Sakihara, making this the most comprehensive resource on the intriguing island of Okinawa.",

        "description": "The Museum of Innocence - set in Istanbul between 1975 and today - tells the story of Kemal, the son of one of Istanbul's richest families, and of his obsessive love for a poor and distant relation, the beautiful Fusun, who is a shop-girl in a small boutique. In his romantic pursuit of F\u00fcsun over the next eight years, Kemal compulsively amasses a collection of objects that chronicles his lovelorn progress-a museum that is both a map of a society and of his heart. The novel depicts a panoramic view of life in Istanbul as it chronicles this long, obsessive love affair; and Pamuk beautifully captures the identity crisis experienced by Istanbul's upper classes that find themselves caught between traditional and westernised ways of being. Orhan Pamuk's first novel since winning the Nobel Prize is a stirring love story and exploration of the nature of romance. Pamuk built The Museum of Innocence in the house in which his hero's fictional family lived, to display Kemal's strange collection of objects associated with Fusun and their relationship. The house opened to the public in 2012 in the Beyoglu district of Istanbul. 'Pamuk has created a work concerning romantic love worthy to stand in the company of Lolita, Madame Bovary and Anna Karenina.' --Financial Times",

        "description": "You\u2019ve gotta love those travel documentaries with celebrities awkwardly trying to make their interactions with locals seem impromptu and organic. Perhaps it\u2019s best to let the writers express the escapism of travel. And why not leave travel writing to Wilkie Collins, the star of Victorian-era mystery and thriller novels? In \"Rambles Beyond Railways\", Collins exchanges his London ale for a Cornish pasty when he writes of his travels around Cornwall. While the Victorians were crazy about building railways, rail access didn\u2019t extend to the whole of Cornwall. Instead, Collins goes by foot across Cornwall with his friend, Henry Brandling, who provided illustrations for the original publication. True to his love of the sensational, Collins explores the enchanting Cornish locations whence stories of ghostly shipwrecks and semi-mythical kings originated. Get lost in Collins\u2019s Cornwall instead of Jeremy Clarkson\u2019s ill-fitting jeans. London-born Wilke Collins (1824-1889) became known in Victorian England for his novels and plays, sometimes writing together with Charles Dickens. His most famous works, \"The Woman in White\" (1859) and \"The Moonstone\" (1868), are examples of the first modern detective novels.",

        "description": "George Orwell set out \u2018to make political writing into an art\u2019, and to a wide extent this aim shaped the future of English literature \u2013 his descriptions of authoritarian regimes helped to form a new vocabulary that is fundamental to understanding totalitarianism. While 1984 and Animal Farm are amongst the most popular classic novels in the English language, this new series of Orwell\u2019s essays seeks to bring a wider selection of his writing on politics and literature to a new readership. In Why I Write, the first in the Orwell\u2019s Essays series, Orwell describes his journey to becoming a writer, and his movement from writing poems to short stories to the essays, fiction and non-fiction we remember him for. He also discusses what he sees as the \u2018four great motives for writing\u2019 \u2013 \u2018sheer egoism\u2019, \u2018aesthetic enthusiasm\u2019, \u2018historical impulse\u2019 and \u2018political purpose\u2019 \u2013 and considers the importance of keeping these in balance. Why I Write is a unique opportunity to look into Orwell\u2019s mind, and it grants the reader an entirely different vantage point from which to consider the rest of the great writer\u2019s oeuvre.

Lesser known are the sculptor's plaster pieces, which represent an important stage in the development of his work leading up to the final bronze sculptures.

        "description": "An examination of machine learning art and its practice in new media art and music. Over the past decade, an artistic movement has emerged that draws on machine learning as both inspiration and medium. In this book, transdisciplinary artist-researcher Sofian Audry examines artistic practices at the intersection of machine learning and new media art, providing conceptual tools and historical perspectives for new media artists, musicians, composers, writers, curators, and theorists. Audry looks at works from a broad range of practices, including new media installation, robotic art, visual art, electronic music and sound, and electronic literature, connecting machine learning art to such earlier artistic practices as cybernetics art, artificial life art, and evolutionary art. Machine learning underlies computational systems that are biologically inspired, statistically driven, agent-based networked entities that program themselves. Audry explains the fundamental design of machine learning algorithmic structures in terms accessible to the nonspecialist while framing these technologies within larger historical and conceptual spaces. Audry debunks myths about machine learning art, including the ideas that machine learning can create art without artists and that machine learning will soon bring about superhuman intelligence and creativity. Audry considers learning procedures, describing how artists hijack the training process by playing with evaluative functions; discusses trainable machines and models, explaining how different types of machine learning systems enable different kinds of artistic practices; and reviews the role of data in machine learning art, showing how artists use data as a raw material to steer learning systems and arguing that machine learning allows for novel forms of algorithmic remixes.",

        "description": "Marcel Duchamp once asked whether it is possible to make something that is not a work of art. This question returns over and over in modernist culture, where there are no longer any authoritative criteria for what can be identified (or excluded) as a work of art. As William Carlos Williams says, A poem can be made of anything, even newspaper clippings.At this point, art turns into philosophy, all art is now conceptual art, and the manifesto becomes the distinctive genre of modernism. This book takes seriously this transformation of art into philosophy, focusing upon the systematic interest that so many European philosophers take in modernism. Among the philosophers Gerald Bruns discusses are Theodor W. Adorno, Maurice Blanchot, Arthur Danto, Stanley Cavell, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Michel Foucault, Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, Jacques Derrida, Jean-Franois Lyotard, Jean-Luc Nancy, Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe, and Emmanuel Levinas.As Bruns demonstrates, the difficulty of much modern and contemporary poetry can be summarized in the idea that a poem is made of words, not of any of the things that we use words to produce: meanings, concepts, propositions, narratives, or expressions of feeling. Many modernist poets have argued that in poetry language is no longer a form of mediation but a reality to be explored and experienced in its own right. But what sort of experience, philosophically, might this be? The problem of the materiality or hermetic character of poetic language inevitably leads to questions of how philosophy itself is to be written and what sort of communitydefines the work of art-or, for that matter, the work of philosophy.In this provocative study, Bruns answers that the culture of modernism is a kind of anarchist community, where the work of art is apt to be as much an event or experience-or, indeed, an alternative form of life-as a formal object. In modern writing, philosophy and poetry fold into one another. In this book, Bruns helps us to see how.",

The merry war between Benedick and Beatrice with the promptings of their friends soon dissolves into farcical love, while Hero's supposed infidelity is shown to be little more than \"much ado about nothing\".",

        "description": "This is a detailed account of the theatre history of Shakespeare's Macbeth from 1607 to the present day. The shortest of the tragedies, Macbeth is compressed, complex and ambiguous and has been variously interpreted. The Introduction describes major productions and performers including David Garrick, Sarah Siddons, Henry Irving, Ellen Terry and Laurence Olivier. Sarah Siddons, the greatest Lady Macbeth, portrayed her as a ruthlessly ambitious woman who dominated her husband. Irving, on the other hand, saw Macbeth as 'a bloody-minded villain', unlike his wife, played by Ellen Terry, who was gentle and devoted. Ian McKellen and Judi Dench, in the most successful production of the last century, were united in their ambition and pursuit of evil. A detailed commentary alongside the New Cambridge Shakespeare text of the play describes how specific episodes and passages have been interpreted in the theatre.",

        "description": "This Student Edition of Brecht's anti-war masterpiece features an extensive introduction and commentary that includes a plot summary, discussion of the context, themes, characters, style and language as well as questions for further study and notes on words and phrases in the text. It is the perfect edition for students of theatre and literature. In this chronicle of the Thirty Years War of the seventeenth century, Mother Courage follows the armies back and forth across Europe, selling provisions and liquor from her canteen wagon. As the action of the play progresses between the years 1624 and 1646 she loses her children to the war but remains indomitable, refusing to part with her livelihood - the wagon. The play is one of the most celebrated examples of Epic Theatre and of Brecht's use of alienation effect to focus attention on the issues of the play above the individual characters. It remains regarded as one of the greatest plays of the twentieth century and one of the great anti-war plays of all time. The Berlin production of 1949, with Helene Weigel as Mother Courage, marked the foundation of the Berliner Ensemble. This volume contains expert notes on the author's life and work, historical and political background to the play, photographs from stage productions and a glossary of difficult words and phrases. The play is translated by Brecht scholar John Willett who did more than anyone else to make Brecht's work available in the English language.",

Here is Mamet at his very best, writing with brutal power about the tough life of tough characters who cajole, connive, wheedle, and wheel and deal for a piece of the action -- where closing a sale can mean a brand new cadillac but losing one can mean losing it all. This masterpiece of American drama is now a major motion picture starring Al Pacino, Jack Lemmon, Alan Arkin, Alex Baldwain, Jonathan Pryce, Ed Harris, and Kevin Spacey.",

The Taming of the Shrew's ongoing appeal is easy to understand - it offers almost production-proof farce, plus the perennially popular joke of the battle of the sexes - but Katherina's story, and the joke of taming an unruly woman have become increasingly controversial. This edition of The Taming of the Shrew examines how theatre directors and performers have explored the complexities of Katherina's story and that of Christopher Sly, the poor man whose story frames that of Katherine. The edition surveys a wide variety of theatrical interpretations of the play in the English-speaking world, particularly in the UK, North America, and Australia and New Zealand. It informs readers about precise details of the stage action in the context of contemporary theatrical, social and political conditions.",

        "description": "Erasmus reached England after a stay in Italy early in the summer of 1510. Soon afterwards, in Thomas More's house at Bucklersbury, he rapidly wrote his famous satire, the Encomium Moriae, or \"Praise of Folly,\" in which Folly celebrates her own praises as the great source of human pleasures. He had been meditating this piece on the long journey from Rome; it is a kaleidoscope of his experiences in Italy, and of earlier memories. As to the title, Moria, the Greek word for \"folly,\" was a playful allusion, of course, to the name of his wise and witty host. This \"Praise of Folly\" is a satire, not only in the modern but in the original sense of that word,\u2014a medley. All classes, all callings, are sportively viewed on the weak side. But in relation to the author's own life and times, the most important topics are the various abuses in the Church, the pedantries of the school-men, and the selfish wars of kings. If this eloquent Folly, as Erasmus presents her, most often wears the mocking smile of Lucian or Voltaire, there are moments also when she wields the terrible lash of Juvenal or of Swift. The popularity of the satire, throughout Europe, was boundless. The mask of jest which it wore was its safeguard; how undignified, how absurd it would have been for a Pope or a King to care what was said by Folly! And, just for that reason, the Encomium Moriae must be reckoned among the forces which prepared the Reformation.",

Hume's comprehensive effort to form an observationally grounded study of human nature employs John Locke's empiric principles to construct a theory of knowledge from which to evaluate metaphysical ideas. A key to modern studies of eighteenth-century Western philosophy, the Treatise considers numerous classic philosophical issues, including causation, existence, freedom and necessity, and morality. Unabridged republication of the edition originally published by Oxford at the Clarendon Press, London, 1888.",

        "description": "Until just yesterday, no society--monogamous or polygamous\u2014had defined marriage as anything other than a male-female union. With clear and cogent arguments, What Is Marriage? explains the rational basis of this historic consensus. It defeats the arguments for recognizing same-sex partnerships as marriages and shows how doing so would harm the common good. Originally published in the Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy, this book\u2019s core argument quickly became the year\u2019s most widely read essay of more than 300,000 scholarly articles posted on the Social Sciences Research Network. Now expanded to address a flurry of prominent responses, What Is Marriage? stands poised to meet its moment as few books of this generation have. If the marriage debate in America is decided in the next few years, it will be either with this book\u2019s help, or despite its powerful arguments. Rhodes Scholar Sherif Girgis, Princeton University professor Robert P. George, and Ryan T. Anderson, editor of the online journal Public Discourse, provide a devastating critique of the claim that equality requires redefining marriage. They point out that any assessment of what \u201cmarriage equality\u201d demands depends on first determining what marriage is\u2014what sort of relationships must be treated as essentially the same. They defend the principle that marriage, as a comprehensive union ordered to family life, requires a man and a woman. And they argue for the great social benefits of enshrining this principle in law. Most compellingly, they show that those who embrace same-sex civil marriage leave themselves no firm ground\u2014none\u2014for not recognizing as marriages every relationship type describable in polite English, including multiple-partner (\u201cpolyamorous\u201d) sexual unions. Finally, What Is Marriage? decisively answer common objections: that the historic view is rooted in bigotry (like laws forbidding interracial marriage); that it is callous to people\u2019s needs; that it can\u2019t show the harm of recognizing same-sex couplings, or the point of recognizing infertile ones; and that it treats a mere \u201csocial construct\u201d as if it were natural, or an unreasoned religious view as if it were rational.",

In addition to analysis by Leo Strauss and a foreword by Tracy B. Strong placing Schmitt\u2019s work into contemporary context, this expanded edition also includes a translation of Schmitt\u2019s 1929 lecture \u201cThe Age of Neutralizations and Depoliticizations,\u201d which the author himself added to the 1932 edition of the book. An essential update on a modern classic, The Concept of the Political, Expanded Edition belongs on the bookshelf of anyone interested in political theory or philosophy.",

        "description": "In this highly original work, Robert Nozick develops new views on philosophy\u2019s central topics and weaves them into a unified philosophical perspective. It is many years since a major work in English has ranged so widely over philosophy\u2019s fundamental concerns: the identity of the self, knowledge and skepticism, free will, the question of why there is something rather than nothing, the foundations of ethics, the meaning of life. Writing in a distinctive and personal philosophical voice, Mr. Nozick presents a new mode of philosophizing. In place of the usual semi-coercive philosophical goals of proof, of forcing people to accept conclusions, this book seeks philosophical explanations and understanding, and thereby stays truer to the original motivations for being interested in philosophy. Combining new concepts, daring hypotheses, rigorous reasoning, and playful exploration, the book exemplifies how philosophy can be part of the humanities.",

        "description": "Highly controversial when it was first published in 1981, Alasdair MacIntyre's After Virtue has since established itself as a landmark work in contemporary moral philosophy. In this book, MacIntyre sought to address a crisis in moral language that he traced back to a European Enlightenment that had made the formulation of moral principles increasingly difficult. In the search for a way out of this impasse, MacIntyre returns to an earlier strand of ethical thinking, that of Aristotle, who emphasised the importance of 'virtue' to the ethical life. More than thirty years after its original publication, After Virtue remains a work that is impossible to ignore for anyone interested in our understanding of ethics and morality today.",

This work, a chapter from Kierkegaard's first major volume, Either/Or, springs from his relationship with his fianc\u00e9e, Regine Olsen. Kierkegaard fell in love with the young woman, ten years his junior, proposed to her, but then broke off their engagement a year later. This event affected Kierkegaard profoundly. Olsen became a muse for him, and a flood of volumes resulted. His attempt to set right, in writing, what he feels was a mistake in his relationship with Olsen taught him the secret of \"indirect communication.\" The Seducer's Diary, then, becomes Kierkegaard's attempt to portray himself as a scoundrel and thus make their break easier for her. Matters of marriage, the ethical versus the aesthetic, dread, and, increasingly, the severities of Christianity are pondered by Kierkegaard in this intense work.",

With a close and studied reading of the major religious texts, Christopher Hitchens documents the ways in which religion is a man-made wish, a cause of dangerous sexual repression, and a distortion of our origins in the cosmos. With eloquent clarity, Hitchens frames the argument for a more secular life based on science and reason, in which hell is replaced by the Hubble Telescope's awesome view of the universe, and Moses and the burning bush give way to the beauty and symmetry of the double helix. In the tradition of Bertrand Russell's Why I Am Not a Christian and Sam Harris's The End of Faith, Christopher Hitchens makes the ultimate case against religion.",

It will keep you entertained for hours, and will satisfy all ages. Recommended for the permanent library of all fantasy readers.\u201d--Books and Movie Reviews. This bundle includes the first two books in Morgan Rice\u2019s #1 Bestselling fantasy series THE SORCERER\u2019S RING (A QUEST OF HEROES and A MARCH OF KINGS), a 17 book epic fantasy series with over 1,000 five star reviews. These two bestselling novels are both here in one convenient file. It is a great introduction to the SORCERER\u2019S RING series and it also makes the perfect gift! A QUEST OF HEROES (BOOK #1 IN THE SORCERER\u2019S RING) revolves around the epic coming of age story of one special boy, a 14 year old from a small village on the outskirts of the Kingdom of the Ring. The youngest of four, the least favorite of his father, hated by his brothers, Thorgrin senses he is different from the others. He dreams of becoming a great warrior, of joining the King\u2019s men and protecting the Ring from the hordes of creatures on the other side of the Canyon. When he comes of age and is forbidden by his father to try out for the King\u2019s Legion, he refuses to take no for an answer: he journeys out on his own, determined to force his way into King\u2019s Court and be taken seriously. But King\u2019s Court is rife with its own family dramas, power struggles, ambitions, jealousy, violence and betrayal. King MacGil must choose an heir from amongst his children, and the ancient Dynasty Sword, the source of all their power, still sits untouched, waiting for the chosen one to arrive. Thorgrin arrives as an outsider and battles to be accepted, and to join the King\u2019s Legion. Thorgrin comes to learn he has mysterious powers he does not understand, that he has a special gift, and a special destiny. Against all odds he falls in love with the king\u2019s daughter, and as their forbidden relationship blossoms, he discovers he has powerful rivals. As he struggles to make sense of his powers, the king\u2019s sorcerer takes him under his wing and tells him of a mother he never knew, in a land far away, beyond the Canyon, beyond even the land of the Dragons. Before Thorgrin can venture out and become the warrior he yearns to be, he must complete his training. But this may be cut short, as he finds himself propelled into the center of royal plots and counterplots, ones that may threaten his love and bring him down\u2014and the entire kingdom with him. With its sophisticated world-building and characterization, A QUEST OF HEROES is an epic tale of friends and lovers, of rivals and suitors, of knights and dragons, of intrigues and political machinations, of coming of age, of broken hearts, of deception, ambition and betrayal. It is a tale of honor and courage, of fate and destiny, of sorcery. It is a fantasy that brings us into a world we will never forget, and which will appeal to all ages and genders. It is 82,000 words.",

        "description": "For lovers of epic fantasy\u2026 In a land where oaths can\u2019t be broken, be careful what promises you make. To break the binding oath is to risk the very magic of Argenterra. Best friends, Sophy and Aria, are on a family trip in Scotland when they find themselves swept away to another world. The lush land of Argenterra is imbued heavily with a magic known as the GIVEN \u2013 but while Aria adapts quickly, able to use and recognize the magic as naturally as if she\u2019d been born in this world, Sophy struggles to find her place. Far from discovering her own magical gifts, Sophy is unable to feel the GIVEN at all. Something about the magic has warped and changed her appearance and she\u2019s lost her vibrancy, becoming a mere shadow of her former self. Previously the attractive, outgoing one, now she is ugly and unable to fit in, whereas Aria has grown in confidence. As Aria thrives, quickly falling in love with a dashing prince, Sophy fights to survive in an increasingly hostile and deadly realm. She pairs up with Oakheart, ambassador to the king, on a quest to discover her true purpose in the kingdom, but soon the darker side of Argenterra and its people becomes apparent to both women. The GIVEN is not without cost \u2013 the laws of this magic dictate that oaths are bound with the GIVEN and the inhabitants of Argenterra bear the mark of the original, ancestral oath to the land. Every promise must be kept or the land\u2019s magic will compel its completion. Only murder can sunder a binding oath and then magic will wane and Argenterra will become the Ungiven Land \u2013 but no native Argenterran has that power. Now trapped by binding promises of their own, Sophy and Aria\u2019s friendship will test oaths and Sophy\u2019s very presence will pose a true threat to Argenterra...",

After all, the prophecy has never been clear on how she is to defeat the Crimson King, only that if it is to be done, she is the one who must find a way. But time is running short, and Jahrra only hopes she'll find the answers before it is too late ... With Nimbronia and the reluctant Creecemind dragons behind them, Jaax and his ward travel with their friends to Dhonoara, the valley of the elves, where the Coalition of Ethoes gathers to prepare for battle. But the Tanaan dragon isn't as confident as usual; there are far too many devious players in this game, and it is no longer just about winning or losing for him. Freedom from the Tyrant and his ancient curse may come at too high a price. As open war looms, both Jahrra and Jaax will be tested in mind, body, heart, and spirit. Old friends and enemies will emerge, and secrets that have remained buried for centuries will finally be revealed. Even if Jahrra does the impossible by destroying the evil festering in the east, it will come at a great cost. For battles are not fought without risk; wars are not won without sacrifice. In the end, Jahrra must find the strength to do what she must, and the courage to endure her greatest challenge yet. A powerful dragon guardian, a headstrong heroine, and a destiny that will make them both the greatest legends of their time . . . The epic conclusion to the Legend of Oescienne series!",

        "description": "The book that topped the international online poll held in Agatha Christie's 125th birthday year to discover which of her 80 crime books was the world's favourite. 1939. Europe teeters on the brink of war. Ten strangers are invited to Soldier Island, an isolated rock near the Devon coast. Cut off from the mainland, with their generous hosts Mr and Mrs U.N. Owen mysteriously absent, they are each accused of a terrible crime. When one of the party dies suddenly they realise they may be harbouring a murderer among their number. The 10 strangers include a reckless playboy, a troubled Harley Street doctor, a formidable judge, an uncouth detective, an unscrupulous mercenary, a God-fearing spinster, two restless servants, a highly decorated general and an anxious secretary. One by one they are picked off. Who will survive? And who is the killer? Copies of an ominous nursery rhyme hang in each room, the murders mimicking the awful fates of its 'Ten Little Soldier Boys'. The clear winner in an international online poll held to discover the world's favourite Agatha Christie book, this new paperback also coincides with a new 3-part BBC TV adaptation featuring a stellar ensemble cast: Douglas Booth, Charles Dance, Maeve Dermody, Burn Gorman, Anna Maxwell Martin, Sam Neill, Miranda Richardson, Toby Stephens, Noah Taylor and Aidan Turner.",

        "description": "Ivan King is an Award Winning and Best Selling Author of over 30 books. His #1 Book on Amazon, Breakfast With Jesus, has become a major success internationally. Mr. King was born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 1977, though his stay in Rio was to be short lived. Adopted from an orphanage, he was raised in Ipatinga's, Valley of Steel. His favorite author is Hemingway; yet his favorite book, is Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath. When he is not writing or reading, he plays chess and the guitar. When Ivan was eight, he read his first book, Judy Blume's Superfudge and the rest is history. That's the story behind how the passion for reading began; how it ends...has yet to be written. Currently, he is working on a couple dozen writing projects and turning some of his novels into screenplays. Ivan\u2019s first published work, Valley of Steel, is a Fiction Novel loosely based on his life growing up in the favelas, or slums, of Brazil. Favorite quote: \u201cIn life, incredible things happen and unforgettable moments do exist; but nothing compares to having been loved by you, and though you rest in peace, I will miss and love you always.\u201d",

Stephen Russ never expected to have to answer that question; he went to work, he stayed in his apartment, sometimes had friends over, and the worst thing he'd had to face was looking for a new job after losing his old one. But that was before a child's desperate scream led him into an alley filled with faceless winged things that almost killed him, before the strange white rat spoke to him, calling itself Silvertail Heartseeker and telling him that this was but the beginning, that the Stars were almost Right and the forces of Azathoth Nine-Armed would soon be unleashed against the world\u2026 before Silvertail said that his courage and willingness to risk himself made him the perfect choice to be one of the defenders of the world against this evil. A defender named Princess Holy Aura, the first of the five Apocalypse Maidens.

The Arunkel empire has stood a thousand years, forged by wealth and conquest, but now rebellion is stirring on the borders and treachery brews in the palace halls. Elsewhere, in a remote mountain village, a young mother sells the prophesies of her sister, Amarta, in order to keep them and her infant child from starving. It's a dangerous game when such revelations draw suspicion and mistrust as often as they earn coin. Yet Amarta's visions are true. And often not at all what the seeker wishes to hear. Now in a tapestry of loyalty, intrigue, magic, and gold, Amarta has become the key to a ruler's ambitions. But is she nothing beyond a tool? As Amarta comes into her own as a seer, she realizes she must do more than predict the future. She must create it.

I highly recommend this novel, and I look forward to her next.\"\u2014David B. Coe, author of best-selling Winds of the Forelands series \"The Seer is something extremely rare these days: a fantasy which is complex, complete, so intricate that you feel the picture goes on far, far beyond the parts of it which are in the book. There is a wonderful depth to it, and the characters and the setting in which the characters find themselves (both horrific and fascinating) made it compelling reading. The story's separate threads left me wondering how the author could possibly weave them together. She did so brilliantly, it was masterful and I was very impressed.\"\u2014Dave Freer, author of the critically acclaimed Dragon's Ring series",

        "description": "LARRY CORREIA'S BEST-SELLING EPIC FANTASY SERIES, SAGA OF THE FORGOTTEN WARRIOR, CONTINUES. Ashok Vadal was once a member of the highest caste in all of Lok. As a Protector, he devoted his life to upholding the Law, rooting out those who still practiced the old ways and delivering swift justice with his ancestor blade Angruvadal. None was more merciless than he in stamping out the lingering belief in gods and demons among the casteless. His brutality was legendary and celebrated. But soon Ashok learned that his life to that point had been a lie. He himself, senior member of the Protector Order, was casteless. He had been nothing more than an unwitting pawn in a political game. His world turned upside down and finding himself on the wrong side of the Law, he began a campaign of rebellion, war, and destruction unlike any Lok had ever seen. Thera had been first daughter of Vane. A member of the Warrior Order, she had spent her life training for combat. Until a strange sight in the heavens appeared one day. Thera was struck by lighting and from that day forward she heard the Voice. A reluctant prophet with the power to see into the future, she fought alongside Ashok Vadal and his company of men known as the Sons of the Black Sword until a shapeshifting wizard with designs on her powers of precognition spirited her away. He holds her prisoner in the House of Assassins. Ashok Vadal and the Sons of the Black Sword march to rescue Thera. With his sword Angruvadal, Ashok was unstoppable. But Angruvadal is gone, shattered to pieces on the demon possessed husk of a warrior. Now, Ashok must fight without the aid of the magic blade for the first time. Thera\u2019s life depends on it. But there is much more at risk in the continent of Lok. Strange forces are working behind the scenes. Ashok Vadal and the Sons of the Black Sword are caught up in a game they do not fully understand, with powerful forces allied against them. Ashok no longer knows what to believe. He is beginning to think perhaps the gods really do exist. If so, he\u2019s warned them to stay out of his way. They would do well to listen. At the publisher's request, this title is sold without DRM (Digital Rights Management). About House of Assassins: \u201cCorreia piles on the intrigue, action, and cliffhangers in the invigorating second Saga of the Forgotten Warrior epic fantasy. . . . Correia also weaves in elements that question the value of belief and the cost of giving authority to those who find more profit in preying on the weak. . . . Brisk fight scenes, lively characters, and plenty of black humor continue to make this series a real pleasure.\u201d\u2014Publishers Weekly",

The snake-god of plague has been awakened by Lucia del Maino, the bastard daughter of the recently overthrown duke of Milan, Phillipo Visconti. With the venomous magic of Orkise at her command, Lucia plots to marry and then murder the usurper who now rules Milan, the condottiere Carlo Sforza\u2014known to friend and foe alike as the Wolf the North. Other trouble is brewing as well. Sforza has his own bastard, Benito Valdosta, who is returning to Venice after having conquered the Byzantine empire. Benito has a score to settle with his father, and he will have the help of his half-brother Marco, who is the embodiment of ancient Etruria\u2019s mighty Winged Lion of St. Mark. Adding further to Sforza\u2019s predicament, yet another power has entered the fray. The terrifying sorcerer Count Mindaug has decided to settle in Milan. Will he ally with Sforza, or oppose him? Either will bring trouble, for if Mindaug aids the usurper he will arouse the fury of the Holy Roman Empire and the Knights of the Holy Trinity. Both of those great forces have sworn to destroy Mindaug and anyone who shelters him. On his side, Sforza has only the skill and cunning of his physician, Francisco Turner\u2014who is on good terms with the Valdosta brothers and may be able to neutralize Venetian hostility. But even if he can, will that be enough to save the Wolf of the North? For out there in the countryside of northern Italy, Orkise is uncoiling all the plagues of hell.

        "description": "First days can be killer. Kat Harper's first day at her new job doesn't go as planned when a runaway cat leads her to a dead body outside of her office building. Things only get worse when Sadie Cramer's death is deemed a homicide, and Kat has to wonder what she's gotten herself into by accepting this position. Much to Kat's\u2014and her police detective boyfriend's\u2014dismay, she soon encounters plenty of people with motive for murder. From an employee fired right before the Thanksgiving holiday, to a grown son ruthlessly cut out of an inheritance, it seems the late career counselor angered several people shortly before her passing. And now it's up to the office building's newly hired amateur sleuth to figure out exactly who is guilty . . . preferably without turning into a victim herself. All of the Cozy Cat Caper Mystery books can be enjoyed as standalones but will be better appreciated as part of the series. The books are light, fun cozy mysteries featuring an animal-loving female amateur sleuth, lovable and not-so-lovable quirky characters, and a page-turning mystery that needs solving.

        "description": "TNR is a proven strategy for controlling the feral cat population\u2014almost as effective as murder for eliminating unwanted neighbors. Kat Harper's friend and fellow animal rescue advocate Imogene Little has spent her entire life defending animal rights. So it's no surprise when their latest mission to neuter an undomesticated tom results in some harsh words exchanged between Imogene and a bitter homeowner named Lenora who doesn't believe feral cats are worth saving. The altercation would normally be a minor blip in their day, but things take a turn for the worse when Lenora winds up dead mere hours after the argument\u2014and she didn't perish from natural causes. Much to Imogene's chagrin, the police identify her as a person of interest in their homicide case. But Imogene isn't the only one with motive. Between a euphoric elderly gentleman planning a celebration to commemorate his wretched neighbor's untimely demise, a young couple often targeted by Lenora over noise violations, and the victim's sister who is set to inherit everything, Kat doesn't have any trouble locating additional suspects. The question is, which one is the true murderer? With so many potential killers to consider, Kat is going to need all of her amateur detective skills to figure out \"whodunit\" this time. She just hopes she can clear her friend's name before Imogene's relationship with the Cherry Hills Police Department\u2014and its unmarried chief\u2014is destroyed forever.

Successful Management by Motivation shows that in a knowledge-based society, this goal cannot be achieved by extrinsic motivation alone. Pay for performance often even hurts because it crowds out intrinsic motivation. To succeed, companies have to find ways of fostering and sustaining intrinsic motivation. With the help of in-depth case studies, representative surveys, and analysis based on a large number of firms and employees, this work identifies the various aspects of motivation in companies and shows how the right combination of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation can be achieved.",

        "description": "This book investigates the relevance of Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of needs as a theory of motivation, whilst taking into account variances in culture and individual experiences and perspectives. Focussing on higher education, the book responds to the call for providing alternative conceptual models, other than those originating from the Anglo-Saxon world. The authors take a contextual approach and use the case of Saudi Arabia to understand motivation in a collectivist, highly religious and conservative society of the Middle East. Providing empirical findings from a study carried out at two Saudi universities differing in their religious outlook, this book reveals a hierarchy of needs that is significantly different from the theory proposed by Maslow. Religion, culture and gender are explored in detail as the authors investigate the relevance of Maslow\u2019s theory in a region that is of growing interest to policy-makers and practitioners in North America and Europe, offering a truly insightful read to an international audience.",

        "description": "Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is one avenue for offering assistance to developing countries in their efforts to grow. Small countries typically have limited resources to direct toward investment attraction programs, so the ability to segment the market (of Multinational Corporations looking to invest) is a crucial skill. This book develops and employs an investment preference analysis model to give evidence that homogenous groups of investors can be identified. Once these groups are identified, their needs - specific preference requirements for laws, regulations, incentives, and general conditions - can be more efficiently addressed.",

Successful Management by Motivation shows that in a knowledge-based society, this goal cannot be achieved by extrinsic motivation alone. Pay for performance often even hurts because it crowds out intrinsic motivation. To succeed, companies have to find ways of fostering and sustaining intrinsic motivation. With the help of in-depth case studies, representative surveys, and analysis based on a large number of firms and employees, this work identifies the various aspects of motivation in companies and shows how the right combination of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation can be achieved.",

The traumatic incident leaves the Jefferson family homeless and devastated. Worse yet, the fire appears to be the result of an arson attack, spurring everyone to question who would do such a thing.

        "description": "Ivan King is an Award Winning and Best Selling Author of over 30 books. His #1 Book on Amazon, Breakfast With Jesus, has become a major success internationally. Mr. King was born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 1977, though his stay in Rio was to be short lived. Adopted from an orphanage, he was raised in Ipatinga's, Valley of Steel. His favorite author is Hemingway; yet his favorite book, is Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath. When he is not writing or reading, he plays chess and the guitar. When Ivan was eight, he read his first book, Judy Blume's Superfudge and the rest is history. That's the story behind how the passion for reading began; how it ends...has yet to be written. Currently, he is working on a couple dozen writing projects and turning some of his novels into screenplays. Ivan\u2019s first published work, Valley of Steel, is a Fiction Novel loosely based on his life growing up in the favelas, or slums, of Brazil. Favorite quote: \u201cIn life, incredible things happen and unforgettable moments do exist; but nothing compares to having been loved by you, and though you rest in peace, I will miss and love you always.\u201d",

She lives an ordinary life away from her witch-ful family for a reason. She got her ordinary fianc\u00e9 and her ordinary job as a journalist using no magic whatsoever, and no inconvenient local murder is going to change her comfortable existence. Even if the entire town is now accusing Aunt Pearl of murdering her guest. Even if her fianc\u00e9 is acting weird and talking about seeing ghosts. Even if the town's sexy new sheriff, Tyler Gates, treats her like the most hexing of all the witches... If you love funny cozy mysteries infused with a dose of humor and the supernatural, you\u0092ll love this paranormal witch cozy!

She\u0092s close to landing a new job, and things are getting cozy with sexy sheriff Tyler Gates. All that changes when she is kidnapped by renegade witch Aunt Pearl, who is hell bent on avenging a friend\u0092s untimely death. Its Las Vegas or bust for all the wrong reasons. Rocco Racatelli is a hunky Vegas kingpin\u0097and the next mob target. Lady Luck has dealt him a losing hand and he wants revenge. When Aunt Pearl is a little too eager to help, project Vegas Vendetta quickly escalates into an all-out mob turf war. As the witches are thrust into Sin City\u0092s seamy underworld, bodies pile up and secrets are exposed. It\u0092s not just the Las Vegas heat that\u0092s scorching...Rocco is intent on winning Cen\u0092s heart. But she only wants the man she left behind in Westwick Corners. All she has to do is solve a murder, out-magic her ornery aunt, and take down the Las Vegas mafia. What could possibly go wrong? When organized crime meets unorganized magic, anything can happen! As the body count climbs, it\u0092s clear that Cen needs more than a miracle in the desert to set things right. 3. Witch and Famous Lights, camera, assassin A Hollywood movie shoot comes to town and journalist Cendrine West is eager for a scoop. Her witchy family also wants in on the action, but shenanigans with the stars soon turn to Tinseltown tragedy. Bodies are piling up faster than a coven\u0092s worth of curses, and everything points back to Cen\u0092s star-struck family. They will stop at nothing in their quest for supernatural stardom, even if that means meddling in a murder investigation. The witches have created one spell of a mess and given the killer a chance to get away with murder. Cen resorts to her own blend of supernatural justice to keep her family in check, but can she unmask the killer before he strikes again? Welcome to the wild, wild Wests! Fans of Janet Evanovich and paranormal mystery, cozy mystery, and wickedly funny witches will love the Westwick Witches! From the author: Westwick Corners isn't your typical small town. Or even a normal ghost town. It's where people go not to be found, and witches go to work their magic without attracting too much attention. The combination makes from some interesting and humorous mysteries, and the witches are always at the center of the action! Ruby's cooking, Cendrine's amateur sleuth and investigator activities, and Aunt Pearl's magic school are always looking for that one secret ingredient that will propel the witches to fame and fortune and put the small town of Westwick Corners back on the map again. The witches are forever cooking up new business opportunities like The Westwick Corners Inn, The Witching Post Bar and Grill, and of course, Pearl's Charm School, where witches go to unravel riddles, spin magic spells, and create their own witch mysteries. Too bad they are forever getting distracted because there are always strange things happening in Westwick Corners, from petty crime to murder. The West family has always been in Westwick Corners and always will be. They descend from a long line of witches who have inhabited Westwick Corners from the beginning. Witches who unlock mysteries, solve crime, and help those in need. They are collectively a kind of a witch of all trades, because pitching in--or is it witching in?-- is what you do in a small town. Everyone helps out. Even Grandma Vi the ghost investigates and sleuths. But when everyone pulls together, it's not always in the same direction! If you like a good puzzle, a good laugh, and a good witch mystery series, you'll love these cozy mystery books! Available as ebook cozy mystery books, cozy mystery paperbacks, and cozy mystery audiobooks too! I am writing the next book in this series of paranormal cozy mysteries, a cozy paranormal that takes place on Christmas Eve. As long as people like these humorous cozy mysteries I will keep on writing them. Thanks for reading!

        "description": "I had put on my slippers and my dressing-gown. I wiped away a tear with which the north wind blowing over the quay had obscured my vision. A bright fire was leaping in the chimney of my study. Ice-crystals, shaped like fern-leaves, were sprouting over the windowpanes and concealed from me the Seine with its bridges and the Louvre of the Valois. I drew up my easy-chair to the hearth, and my table-volante, and took up so much of my place by the fire as Hamilcar deigned to allow me. Hamilcar was lying in front of the andirons, curled up on a cushion, with his nose between his paws. His think find fur rose and fell with his regular breathing. At my coming, he slowly slipped a glance of his agate eyes at me from between his half-opened lids, which he closed again almost at once, thinking to himself, \"It is nothing; it is only my friend.\" \"Hamilcar,\" I said to him, as I stretched my legs\u00d1\"Hamilcar, somnolent Prince of the City of Books\u00d1thou guardian nocturnal! Like that Divine Cat who combated the impious in Heliopolis\u00d1in the night of the great combat\u00d1thou dost defend from vile nibblers those books which the old savant acquired at the cost of his slender savings and indefatigable zeal. Sleep, Hamilcar, softly as a sultana, in this library, that shelters thy military virtues; for verily in thy person are united the formidable aspect of a Tatar warrior and the slumbrous grace of a woman of the Orient. Sleep, thou heroic and voluptuous Hamilcar, while awaiting the moonlight hour in which the mice will come forth to dance before the Acta Sanctorum of the learned Bolandists!\" The beginning of this discourse pleased Hamilcar, who accompanied it with a throat-sound like the song of a kettle on the fire. But as my voice waxed louder, Hamilcar notified me by lowering his ears and by wrinkling the striped skin of his brow that it was bad taste on my part so to declaim. \"This old-book man,\" evidently thought Hamilcar, \"talks to no purpose at all while our housekeeper never utters a word which is not full of good sense, full of significance\u00d1containing either the announcement of a meal or the promise of a whipping. One knows what she says. But this old man puts together a lot of sounds signifying nothing.\" So thought Hamilcar to himself. Leaving him to his reflections, I opened a book, which I began to read with interest; for it was a catalogue of manuscripts. I do not know any reading more easy, more fascinating, more delightful than that of a catalogue. The one which I was reading\u00d1edited in 1824 by Mr. Thompson, librarian to Sir Thomas Raleigh\u00d1sins, it is true, by excess of brevity, and does not offer that character of exactitude which the archivists of my own generation were the first to introduce into works upon diplomatics and paleography. It leaves a good deal to be desired and to be divined. This is perhaps why I find myself aware, while reading it, of a state of mind which in nature more imaginative than mine might be called reverie. I had allowed myself to drift away this gently upon the current of my thoughts, when my housekeeper announced, in a tone of ill-humor, that Monsieur Coccoz desired to speak with me.",

        "description": "THE three principal prisons in London in the fourteenth century were the Fleet, the King\u00d5s Bench and the Marshalsea, but Newgate took precedence in interest because identified with its earliest history. All have their peculiar histories full of interesting associations, replete with memories of famous inmates and striking incidents, and all are worthy of detailed description. All alike received prisoners for debt and on occasion, more heinous offenders, especially in the earlier years of their existence. The old King\u00d5s Bench was the peculiar prison for the Court of that name, but it also took debtors committed by the Court of Exchequer and the Court of Common Pleas. The Marshalsea Court, so called from having been originally under the control of the Knight Marshal of the Royal Household, was at first intended to settle differences between the lesser servants of the palace, and had its own judge, counsel and attorneys, but none except members of Clifford\u00d5s Inn were permitted to practise in this court. The jurisdiction of this court extended twelve miles round Whitehall, excluding the city of London. It also served the Admiralty Court and received prisoners charged with piracy. The Fleet prison took its name from the little stream long stigmatised as the \u00d2Fleet Ditch,\u00d3 the open sewer or water-way which rose in the eastern ridge of Hampstead Hill, flowed by \u00d2Oldbourne\u00d3 or Holborn under four bridges to discharge into the Thames on the west side of Blackfriars bridge. As time passed this ditch, after being deepened once or twice to allow for water traffic, became more and more pestilential and was at length filled up and arched over, becoming then the site of Fleet Market in what is now known as Farringdon Street, on which the main gates of the prison opened. The building was of great antiquity and is first mentioned in authentic records about A. D. 1197. A deed of that date granted it to the safe keeping of one Nathaniel de Leveland and his son Robert, in conjunction with the King\u00d5s Houses at Westminster. It is stated that the Fleet prison had been the inheritance of the Levelands since the time of the Norman Conquest. Four years later this same Robert de Leveland petitioned King John for leave to hand over the wardenship of the Fleet to Simon Fitz-Robert, archdeacon of Wells, while he, Leveland, proceeded with the crusaders to the Holy Land. He returned very shortly afterward, as appears from a grant of moneys made him by the City of London in 1205, his salary for guardianship of the prison. His wife Margaret was also granted an allowance as keeper of the Westminster Royal Houses.",

        "description": "'Benjamin Hardy is one of the leading voices on well-being and productivity. Willpower Doesn't Work is an insightful guide to help us thrive in today's world' Arianna Huffington If you're relying on willpower alone to help you lose weight, improve your relationships or achieve more at work, you're doomed to fail. The environment around us is far too powerful, stimulating, addicting and stressful to overcome it through sheer determination. Willpower, grit, being positive - basically, all the tools you've been told are the keys to creating lasting change in your life - are insufficient in this high-paced, information-overloaded world we live in. The only way to stop just surviving and learn to truly thrive in today's world is to proactively shape your environment. That's the premise of Willpower Doesn't Work, by organisational psychologist and Medium's most-read self-help guru Benjamin Hardy. Building on copious existing research, as well as his own experience of growing up in a broken family afflicted by addiction and drug use, Hardy explains how people can change their lives on every level by making small, impactful changes in their environment like: * Creating 'enriched environments' - using tougher challenges and self-imposed deadlines to force yourself to rise to the occasion. * Growing into your goals - using radical personal accountability to keep yourself on target and on track. * Becoming the teacher - stepping into a leadership role (even before you think you're ready) to accelerate your skills. * Rotating your environments - getting out of your rut by literally changing your physical surroundings throughout the day or week. From simple steps like removing things that conflict with your values from your environment (like junk food, junk media, even junk people), to incorporating new tools (like fasting or adding 'positive triggers' to your world), these lessons make it possible to consciously shape your surroundings so you can lead a more productive and happier life. Hardy leans on his own story of making the decision to foster three young children to illustrate how any shift, no matter how huge, can become 'the new normal' if you support that change with a productive environment.",

        "description": "This book pioneers evidence-based research on healthy aging through the application of self determination theory (SDT). Its uniqueness is located in the fact that to date, no other work has applied SDT to the empirical study of aging populations. The authors focus on how SDT drives healthy, successful and active aging, and note that the motivation factors underpinning healthy aging are often neglected, or altogether absent, in the existing literature. This edited volume is particularly timely given the expanding aging crisis in many North American, European and Asian contexts. The collection of chapters meets this challenge head-on in comparing these contexts vis-a-vis a broad international scope, and subsequent discussions on important specialty issues in aging, such as hearing and memory loss. The work offers global perspectives on aging, autonomy and associated life challenges, as well as factors relating to the sustainability of healthy aging in terms of physical and mental well-being. This book will be highly relevant to researchers in the SDT community, as well as specialists in aging and gerontology. It will also be of interest to lifespan psychologists and developmental psychologists.",

        "description": "The goal of this book is to stimulate an awareness of a person's Authentic Self. For those who would choose to embark or continue on the simple but often difficult path of being better, the author presents a remarkably clear and practical guide that can be of immense benefit to anyone who aspires to grow in living life more fully and authentically. Exercises and suggestions are provided, with special attention directed to a person's inner space where we are encouraged to locate and awaken the neglected or dormant resources present in every human being and apply them in the world. \"Being better\" refers to improvement, but not only at one level. It seems reasonable to focus on three: the material, mental, and transpersonal. These are presented and discussed sequentially, and these concepts should be applied practically in day-to-day life to learn their meaning and value. A series of fifty-nine process activities are included, exploring empirically and experientially the validity that learning and being better are actions, not merely ideas. At each step, these activities consider, refine, and validate notions of who and what we are and how to be better. By increments, we are led to explore and to immerse ourselves fully in life first our own, then the lives of others, and ultimately the source of life itself.",

        "description": "Science and technology have long been regarded as important determinants of economic growth. Edwin Mansfield (1971, pp. 1- 2), a pioneer in the economics of technological change, noted: Technological change is an important, if not the most important, factor responsible for economic growth . . . without question, [it] is one of the most important determinants of the shape and evolution of the American economy. Science and technology are even more important in the \"new economy,\" with its greater emphasis on the role of intellectual property and knowledge transfer. Therefore, it is unfortunate that most individuals rarely have the opportunity to explore the economic implications of science and technology. As a result, the antecedents and consequences of technological change are poorly understood by many in the general public. This lack of understanding is reflected in a recent survey conducted by the National Science Board (2000), summarized in Science & Engineering Indicators. ' As shown in Table 1. 1, the findings of the survey indicated that many Americans, despite a high level of interests in such matters, are not as well-informed about technological issues as they are about other policy issues. As shown in the table, individuals self assess, based on a scale from 1 to 100, their interest in science and technology policy issues as being relatively high, yet they self assess their knowledge or informedness about these issues relatively lower.",

Australia, China, Japan and Korea populated the top ten medals list at the 2012 London Olympics. Pacific Rim countries are major consumers of international sports and domestic professional sports have expanded continuously over time. Nippon Professional Baseball and the Korean Baseball Organization are the second and third largest baseball leagues measured by attendance and revenue following Major League Baseball in the U.S. This book also includes event studies of team ownership, assessment of human capital markets, analysis of the relationship between attendance and competitive balance, the components of fan demand in common the world over, and business decisions concerning attendance and pricing. There is already demand for comprehensive study of the sports business in the Pacific Rim as witnessed by this growth. This book will be of interest of researchers studying and/or teaching in the fields of sports economics and sports management as well as a general audience interested in business governance around the world.",

        "description": "The goal of this book is to stimulate an awareness of a person's Authentic Self. For those who would choose to embark or continue on the simple but often difficult path of being better, the author presents a remarkably clear and practical guide that can be of immense benefit to anyone who aspires to grow in living life more fully and authentically. Exercises and suggestions are provided, with special attention directed to a person's inner space where we are encouraged to locate and awaken the neglected or dormant resources present in every human being and apply them in the world. \"Being better\" refers to improvement, but not only at one level. It seems reasonable to focus on three: the material, mental, and transpersonal. These are presented and discussed sequentially, and these concepts should be applied practically in day-to-day life to learn their meaning and value. A series of fifty-nine process activities are included, exploring empirically and experientially the validity that learning and being better are actions, not merely ideas. At each step, these activities consider, refine, and validate notions of who and what we are and how to be better. By increments, we are led to explore and to immerse ourselves fully in life first our own, then the lives of others, and ultimately the source of life itself.",

        "description": "This Brief brings together empirical accounts that contribute to the investigation of the cultural phenomena of deep personal experiences. It examines everyday life experiences and its influence on the development of successful social interactions. Issues of silence, the subjective feelings of opportunities, and culturally canalized feelings of \u201cbeing here\u201d or \u201cbeing influenced by others\" are all deep personal experiences that are rooted within the framework of cultural psychology. By bringing together the discourses of Dialogical Self Theory (DST) and Cultural Psychology of Semiotic Mediation for a new generation of researchers who address issues of this phenomenon, chapters aim to link phenomena-saturated empirical accounts with general theoretical innovations. In addition, the Brief studies socially relevant issues from the lenses of Cultural Psychology. Topics featured in this Brief include: Globalization and its effect on identity and personal experiences. The subjective nature of opportunities. Migrating identities across generations. Serious illness and its influence on communication. Deep Experiencing will be of interest to researchers, professors, and graduate students in the fields of psychology, cognitive psychology, medicine, anthropology, social work, and aesthetics.",

Yet when the pathologist informs Clare about a post mortem of a young woman found in the Kinness Burn, and with some similarities to Alison\u2019s case, it seems there\u2019s a strong chance that there\u2019s a killer on the loose in St Andrews.

        "description": "A pair of imaginative science fiction story collections from the #1 New York Times\u2013bestselling author of Spartacus, Freedom Road, and the Immigrants saga. Over his long and illustrious career, New York Times\u2013bestselling author and prolific novelist Howard Fast proved himself a master of any literary genre, from historical fiction in Spartacus to family generational drama in his bestselling Immigrants saga. Although his output in fantasy and science fiction is relatively modest, these two short story collections, reminiscent of classic Twilight Zone episodes, demonstrate that Fast\u2019s imagination knew no boundaries. The General Zapped an Angel: Nearly forty years after the publication of his first story, \u201cWrath of Purple,\u201d in the science fiction magazine Amazing Stories, Fast returned to the genre with a set of nine supremely entertaining tales. In this collection, a Vietnam general shoots down what appears to be an angel, a man sells his soul to the devil for a copy of the next day\u2019s Wall Street Journal, and a group of alien beings bestow a mouse with human thought and emotion. \u201cThese stories amply display Fast\u2019s considerable gifts as a writer\u2014his clear, concise, often elegant prose, his sense of humor, his gift of sympathetic imagination, and sheer talent as a storyteller.\u201d \u2014Tangent A Touch of Infinity: This follow-up to The General Zapped an Angel offers thirteen brisk and engrossing science fiction stories. In \u201cThe Hoop,\u201d a scientist builds a portal to an unknown destination, which the mayor of New York City hijacks to use as a garbage dump until the location\u2019s surprising\u2014and hilarious\u2014revelation. And in \u201cThe Egg,\u201d set three thousand years in the future, a research team discovers an egg, something they have never seen before, cryogenically frozen in a nuclear bunker. \u201cFast, a master of economy . . . spins his stories quickly and most effectively.\u201d \u2014Associated Press",

        "description": "\"What's Next,\" by Geoffrey Keane, is a science fiction novel with a setting of one- thousand years into the future. The author projects that eventually, many of us will have our own personal android servant; manufactured from synthetic bone, muscle and skin; having a computer for a brain; and this, he also projects, will exponentially change the degree and intensity to which we will interact, and receive much greater assistance from the computer technology of the distant future. How many years do you imagine life expectancy will expand to, many generations from now? This author's projections might surprise you; some of what Keane has imagined to eventually play out, may expand your own horizons, in terms of considering what we might be heading towards in the future, provided things keep developing in the directions that they currently seem to be, in today's world; not only technologically speaking, but in terms of societal norms, and the legal system. Keane also offers his imagination of what the future political structure will ultimately evolve into, in the US, and around the world in general; and this scenario offers a keen perspective on the long-run playing out of current trends relating to liberal, versus conservative ideals. One primary focus and emphasis that this story centers around, is the author's insights regarding the impact of societal norms surrounding sexuality and sexual offense; and his projections of what might ultimately come to pass, if things continue to trend in the direction we seem to be moving in, in the US, along these lines. This entertaining novel is an imaginative tale encompassing an expansive, worldly view, on a range of issues; from morality to politics, to finance, to addiction; sharing a broader perspective on humanity in general. - Blurb: This is a science fiction story with a setting of a thousand years into the future.

        "description": "Groundbreaking study of science fiction's relation to colonialism and imperialism This is the first full-length study of emerging Anglo-American science fiction's relation to the history, discourses, and ideologies of colonialism and imperialism. Nearly all scholars and critics of early science fiction acknowledge that colonialism is an important and relevant part of its historical context, and recent scholarship has emphasized imperialism's impact on late Victorian Gothic and adventure fiction and on Anglo-American popular and literary culture in general. John Rieder argues that colonial history and ideology are crucial components of science fiction's displaced references to history and its engagement in ideological production. He proposes that the profound ambivalence that pervades colonial accounts of the exotic \"other\" establishes the basic texture of much science fiction, in particular its vacillation between fantasies of discovery and visions of disaster. Combining original scholarship and theoretical sophistication with a clearly written presentation suitable for students as well as professional scholars, this study offers new and innovative readings of both acknowledged classics and rediscovered gems. Includes discussion of works by Edwin A. Abbott, Edward Bellamy, Edgar Rice Burroughs, John W. Campbell, George Tomkyns Chesney, Arthur Conan Doyle, H. Rider Haggard, Edmond Hamilton, W. H. Hudson, Richard Jefferies, Henry Kuttner, Alun Llewellyn, Jack London, A. Merritt, Catherine L. Moore, William Morris, Garrett P. Serviss, Mary Shelley, Olaf Stapledon, and H. G. Wells.",

When a coup removes Colonel Marcus Harris, commander of the maintenance battalion, in favor of his executive officer, the colonel and a loyal second lieutenant, Kurt Dixon, are jailed. When Dixon escapes, he hides in a battle suit to avoid detection. He accidentally activates it and is propelled into outer space. There, he is rescued by a scout of the new Galactic Protectorate...a ramshackle, barely-functioning organization whose leaders are fighting amongst themselves. The Galactic Protectorate, despite its name, has lost most of the technical expertise to do even routine maintenance on their own equipment. Both sides have something the other needs. But can they possibly work together? And if they do, will it be war -- or the start of a new Galactic Empire? Theodore Cogswell's classic science fiction novella is available in ebook form for the first time in more than a decade!",

        "description": "Dan Noble is an old Vampire, perhaps the oldest in the world. One night on the prowl, he is inexplicably drawn to a plain-looking university student. But Nina Wright is not as boring as she seems: she meets Dan's charm with the allure of her own, and the two share an unforgettable night. When Dan tries and fails to compel Nina to forget their encounter, he suspects that she is no ordinary human. And when a gang of bloodthirsty vampires singles her out for a vicious kidnapping, he realizes the girl he has fallen head over heels for may very well be a Human Immortal, a being of awesome power. Nina will be able to reclaim her supernatural gifts if she chooses a mate of her own lineage, Nature's Immortals: a Dragon, Were, or Fae. As a Vampire, Dan would only stand in the way of her destiny. Will he find the courage to give up his true love just as soon as he has found her? Unveiling is Book 1 of the Mythical Creatures Series, in which powerful Immortal beings battle for justice in a magical world just beyond the veil of our own.",

        "description": "This specially-priced set contains three complete horror novels. THE STORM A small town in Kentucky is about to learn fear. Resting in the foothills of Appalachia, Coal Gap is the kind of place where everybody knows one another and people move to raise their children. One of those children is 10-year-old Billy Griffith, who harbors a secret of an unlimited power of the mind. Unfortunately for Billy, his special abilities can't remain hidden forever, and a stormy darkness gathers around Coal Gap, a maelstrom zeroing in on the boy. Within this storm is a stranger with powers of his own to raise the dead and have them do his bidding. This stranger wants Billy's powers for himself, and he does not come alone. THE BASEMENT A new house, a new job, the future before them, the Dinsmores thought they had everything. Yet dreams of the good life quickly give way to a reality of darkness as the young couple begins to move into their new home. For something looms in the basement of the house, something that brings cold, that brings memories and fear and hatred. Terrible things happened in that house long ago, culminating in the basement itself, and now after the house has sat empty for years, something in the basement has found a direction for its rage. The Dinsmores will never be the same. Even if they survive. BIBLE CAMP When a group of young people are sent by their church to clean up an old bible camp in the mountains, none of them knows the secrets of the tragedy that happened there decades earlier. Meeting with the camp\u2019s caretaker, they soon learn some of the tale, but it\u2019s only when night falls and death strikes that they discover true pain and terror. As they are slain one by one, those left struggle to survive, racing through the camp and the woods while searching for safety. But when axes fall and hatchets are slung, throats cut and heads removed, can any hope to live through the night?",

The good kind, of course\u201d (BuzzFeed) from the Jordan Peele of horror literature, Stephen Graham Jones. \u201cSome girls just don\u2019t know how to die\u2026\u201d Shirley Jackson meets Friday the 13th in My Heart Is a Chainsaw, written by the New York Times bestselling author of The Only Good Indians Stephen Graham Jones, called \u201ca literary master\u201d by National Book Award winner Tananarive Due and \u201cone of our most talented living writers\u201d by Tommy Orange. Alma Katsu calls My Heart Is a Chainsaw \u201ca homage to slasher films that also manages to defy and transcend genre.\u201d On the surface is a story of murder in small-town America. But beneath is its beating heart: a biting critique of American colonialism, Indigenous displacement, and gentrification, and a heartbreaking portrait of a broken young girl who uses horror movies to cope with the horror of her own life. Jade Daniels is an angry, half-Indian outcast with an abusive father, an absent mother, and an entire town that wants nothing to do with her. She lives in her own world, a world in which protection comes from an unusual source: horror movies\u2026especially the ones where a masked killer seeks revenge on a world that wronged them. And Jade narrates the quirky history of Proofrock as if it is one of those movies. But when blood actually starts to spill into the waters of Indian Lake, she pulls us into her dizzying, encyclopedic mind of blood and masked murderers, and predicts exactly how the plot will unfold. Yet, even as Jade drags us into her dark fever dream, a surprising and intimate portrait emerges\u2026a portrait of the scared and traumatized little girl beneath the Jason Voorhees mask: angry, yes, but also a girl who easily cries, fiercely loves, and desperately wants a home. A girl whose feelings are too big for her body. My Heart Is a Chainsaw is her story, her homage to horror and revenge and triumph.",

What frightens us, what unnerves us? What causes that delicious shiver of fear to travel the lengths of our spines? It seems the answer changes every year. Every year the bar is raised; the screw is tightened. Ellen Datlow knows what scares us; the twenty-one stories and poems included in this anthology were chosen from magazines, webzines, anthologies, literary journals, and single author collections to represent the best horror of the year. Legendary editor Ellen Datlow (Poe: New Tales Inspired by Edgar Allan Poe), winner of multiple Hugo, Bram Stoker, and World Fantasy awards, joins Night Shade Books in presenting The Best Horror of the Year, Volume One. Skyhorse Publishing, under our Night Shade and Talos imprints, is proud to publish a broad range of titles for readers interested in science fiction (space opera, time travel, hard SF, alien invasion, near-future dystopia), fantasy (grimdark, sword and sorcery, contemporary urban fantasy, steampunk, alternative history), and horror (zombies, vampires, and the occult and supernatural), and much more. While not every title we publish becomes a New York Times bestseller, a national bestseller, or a Hugo or Nebula award-winner, we are committed to publishing quality books from a diverse group of authors.",

        "description": "Emerging as the dark side of Romanticism, horror is one of literature\u2019s oldest genres. Its history is so diverse it\u2019s sometimes difficult to define. Are moody stories about ghosts and vampires related to gory tales of beasts and zombies? And what about the more realistic terrors of murderous rogues and diabolical doctors? The emotion of fear unifies the 14 stories in First Came Fear: New Tales of Horror. But fear is legion in its varieties. The authors skillfully navigate terror of all types. M.P. Diederich\u2019s \u201cDressage for Beginners\u201d and Christopher Calix\u2019s \u201cThe Wedding Gift\u201d are fine examples of the ghoulish humor tradition while J.P. Whitmer\u2019s \u201cLoved to Death\u201d will frighten you in a stunningly visceral way. Oliver Ledesma\u2019s \u201cAtabey\u201d and Samantha Pilecki\u2019s \u201cRoser and the Guide to the Inexplicable\u201d impart fear through non-traditional storytelling and Sarah K. Stephens\u2019 \u201cThe Factory\u201d shows how effectively, and chillingly, horror can tackle social issues. All the stories are accompanied by Luke Spooner\u2019s dramatic art, which combines Gothic macabre with echoes of classic horror illustration. The entire collection will have you gripping the edge of your seat or biting your fingernails, yet leave you longing for more!",

        "description": "\u201cThe oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear, and the oldest and strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown.\u201d \u2014H. P. Lovecraft This statement was true when H. P. Lovecraft first wrote it at the beginning of the twentieth century, and it remains true at the beginning of the twenty-first century. The only thing that has changed is what is unknown. With each passing year, science, technology, and the march of time shine light into the craggy corners of the universe, making the fears of an earlier generation seem quaint. But this \u201clight\u201d creates its own shadows. The Best Horror of the Year, edited by Ellen Datlow, chronicles these shifting shadows. It is a catalog of terror, fear, and unpleasantness, as articulated by today\u2019s most challenging and exciting writers. The best horror writers of today do the same thing that horror writers of a hundred years ago did. They tell good stories\u2014stories that scare us. And when these writers tell really good stories that really scare us, Ellen Datlow notices. She\u2019s been noticing for more than a quarter century. For twenty-one years, she coedited The Year\u2019s Best Fantasy and Horror, and for the last six years, she\u2019s edited this series. In addition to this monumental cataloging of the best, she has edited hundreds of other horror anthologies and won numerous awards, including the Hugo, Bram Stoker, and World Fantasy awards. More than any other editor or critic, Ellen Datlow has charted the shadowy abyss of horror fiction. Join her on this journey into the dark parts of the human heart . . . either for the first time . . . or once again.

Indeed, no novel in the English tradition even remotely approximates the thoroughness, sophistication, and clear-sightedness with which New Grub Street explores the social and economic contexts in which writing, publishing, and reading take place. The critical introduction to this edition gives an account of Gissing\u2019s life and times and an overview of the most important stylistic and thematic features of New Grub Street; special attention is given to the writing and publishing professions in late-Victorian England, emphasizing the range of social and economic positions that writers occupied during the period. This Broadview edition also includes a rich selection of historical material on the literary world of London through the centuries, authorship as a profession, and Gissing\u2019s life and work.",

        "description": "THE GREAT GATSBY is a 1925 novel written by American author F. Scott Fitzgerald that follows a cast of characters living in the fictional town of West Egg on prosperous Long Island in the summer of 1922. The story primarily concerns the young and mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby and his quixotic passion and obsession for the beautiful former debutante Daisy Buchanan. Considered to be Fitzgerald's magnum opus, The Great Gatsby explores themes of decadence, idealism, resistance to change, social upheaval, and excess, creating a portrait of the Jazz Age or the Roaring Twenties that has been described as a cautionary tale regarding the American Dream. Fitzgerald-inspired by the parties he had attended while visiting Long Island's north shore-began planning the novel in 1923, desiring to produce, in his words, \"\"something new-something extraordinary and beautiful and simple and intricately patterned.\"\" Progress was slow, with Fitzgerald completing his first draft following a move to the French Riviera in 1924. His editor, Maxwell Perkins, felt the book was vague and persuaded the author to revise over the next winter. Fitzgerald was repeatedly ambivalent about the book's title and he considered a variety of alternatives, including titles that referenced the Roman character Trimalchio; the title he was last documented to have desired was Under the Red, White, and Blue. In its first year, the book sold only 20,000 copies. Fitzgerald died in 1940, believing himself to be a failure and his work forgotten. However, the novel experienced a revival during World War II, and became a part of American high school curricula and numerous stage and film adaptations in the following decades. Today, The Great Gatsby is widely considered to be a literary classic and a contender for the title \"\"Great American Novel.\"\" In 1998, the Modern Library editorial board voted it the 20th century's best American novel and second best English-language novel of the same time period.",

She also was part of a group of English intellectuals, writers, and artists, graduates of Cambridge, called the Bloomsbury group. Being the most popular of Woolf\u2019s novel during her lifetime, \u201cThe Years\u201d is a criticism of British society at the turn of the century.

Each section of the story takes place during a single day of a year, in a particular mo-ment of the season.",

        "description": "The book takes as its theme the relationship between literature and the contemporary means of production and distribution collectively termed 'the media' - in particular, film and television. The intention of the book is to explore and evaluate the mutual opportunities and restrictions in this relationship. In the grammar of our culture there seems to be an accepted opinion that print is superior in terms of cultural production to film, radio or television, that to read a book is somehow a 'higher' cultural activity than seeing a play on television or seeing a film. By the same token, a novel is a 'superior' work of art to film or television. The longer perspective reveals that traditionally there always is a greater respect paid to the previous mode of literary production - poetry was superior to drama, poetic drama was superior to the novel, and film attained cult and classic status initially over television.",

        "description": "Who is more important: the reader, or the writer? Originally published in French in 1966, Pierre Macherey's first and most famous work, \"A Theory of Literary Production\" dared to challenge perceived wisdom, and quickly established him as a pivotal figure in literary theory. In this provocative work, Macherey puts the focus as much on the reader as the writer, stating that the very act of reading is a form of production in its own right, generating interpretation and meanings which are beyond the control of the author. Part of the birth of a whole new branch of post-structuralist theory, Macherey's work also influenced a new generation of critics among them Jacques Derrida, his contemporary, and Terry Eagleton. His ideas have also led some observers to claim that he announced the death of the author fully two years before Roland Barthes' famous essay.",

Drawing on the archives of Heinemann\u2019s African Writers Series, it highlights the procedures, relationships, demands, ideologies, and counterpressures engendered by the publication of three major authors: Chinua Achebe, Wole Soyinka, and Ngugi wa Thiongo. As a study of the history and techniques of African literary texts, this book advances a theory of reciprocity of effects - what it terms 'auto-heteronomy' - to describe the dynamic of formalist activism by which texts anticipate and shape the forces of literary production in advance. It serves as a departure from the 'death of the author' thesis by reconsidering the role of the author in African literature and culture industry, as well as the influence of African publics on writers\u2019 aesthetic choices, and on the overall processes of production. This work is a major contribution to African literary history, literary criticism, and book history.",
